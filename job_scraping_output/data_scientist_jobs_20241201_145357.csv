Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer

The Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer is responsible for developing and maintaining the core design and analysis software applications used by the Natrium project. This application, consisting of the Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI) framework and its physics plugin components, enables engineers to digitally represent and analyze the Natrium reactor core in a holistic approach that couples multiple nuclear design disciplines together. As a lead they will work with other team members in a technical leadership role to coordinate efforts and drive projects to completion. The Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer will work in a fast-paced environment that utilizes the latest industry practices and tools to develop, document, control, and maintain the application for use on Linux-based high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. The Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer will leverage both their programming and technical writing skills to ensure that the application meets the needs of the Natrium core design and analysis team and is compliant with TerraPower procedures that implement regulatory requirements for software.

The Engineer will join the Nuclear Methods group, which is a geographically diverse team of nuclear engineers supporting neutronics methods development for the Natrium project. The group develops methods, models, and tools that support evaluating the performance of Natrium reactor core structures, systems, and components.

The ideal candidate possesses experience in both software development and multiphysics core analyses. Knowledge and experience with fast reactors physics is also preferred. In addition, experience with software quality assurance is preferred. As a lead the candidate should have experience in technical leadership and show a capacity to drive technical projects to completion.

Responsibilities

• Use configuration control software (i.e., Git) to develop, test, document, and maintain the Natrium core design and analysis software application

• Support coordination of release cycles using Jira to meet project milestones

We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build anywhere-on the edge, on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 developers joining MongoDB every month, it's no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.

MongoDB is seeking a Senior Software Engineer with advanced software engineering skills and experience in code modernization & building tools that can traverse code structures programmatically. Joining this team, you'll be pivotal in a product engineering group dedicated to helping users navigate code conversion challenges with AI's support.

We are seeking candidates located in North America for in-office, remote, or hybrid work options.

Many organizations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating costs, and inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in the cloud and on-premises. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB.

Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. The Application Modernization team, already instrumental in this area, aids developers in making the shift from relational databases to MongoDB via Relational Migrator. Now, they're broadening their toolkit and are keen on modernizing code using a mix of AI and traditional text processing.
Our ideal candidate will have
5+ years of experience in Java in building large-scale enterprise applications
Proficiency in Javascript and familiarity with common database access patterns and frameworks in one or more languages
Knowledge of enterprise-scale software architectures, application development methodologies, and software deployment and operations
Experience developing enterprise applications using relational databases and employing SQL and stored procedures with Oracle, MS SQL Server, Sybase and/or PostgreSQL databases
Experience in using and developing with MongoDB and JSON-based Document models is highly desirable
Experience with tools and methodologies for code analysis, refactoring, and automated testing
Problem-solving skills, including collaborating across disciplines and teams to devise creative solutions to technical and business challenges
Willingness to dive into a complex domain, ask the right questions, and bring new software tools and technologies to solve customer problems
Excellent communication skills (both spoken and written), within the team and in customer meetings
A good understanding of Generative AI concepts, tools, and services is a big plus, as is any experience building new applications/tools using Generative AI
A strong interest in how AI-supported toolchains can improve application development
Position Expectations
Execute a comprehensive code modernisation strategy that aligns transitioned code with cutting-edge practices
Design and optimise sophisticated code parsers to transform legacy code structures using techniques such as AST, into standardised formats
Collaborate with stakeholders to define and implement a code modernisation strategy, ensuring that transformed code aligns with modern software practices while preserving original functionality
Develop and maintain a robust code parser to accurately interpret legacy code structures and convert them into a standardised format like an abstract syntax tree (AST)
Provide thought leadership to the engineering team on using emerging technologies, frameworks and approaches to solve different problems
Collaborate closely with product managers and other engineers to understand business priorities and propose new solutions
Contribute and maintain the high quality of the codebase with tests that provide a high level of functional coverage and non-functional aspects with load testing, unit testing, integration testing, etc
