Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer

The Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer is responsible for developing and maintaining the core design and analysis software applications used by the Natrium project. This application, consisting of the Advanced Reactor Modeling Interface (ARMI) framework and its physics plugin components, enables engineers to digitally represent and analyze the Natrium reactor core in a holistic approach that couples multiple nuclear design disciplines together. As a lead they will work with other team members in a technical leadership role to coordinate efforts and drive projects to completion. The Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer will work in a fast-paced environment that utilizes the latest industry practices and tools to develop, document, control, and maintain the application for use on Linux-based high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. The Lead Nuclear Methods Software Engineer will leverage both their programming and technical writing skills to ensure that the application meets the needs of the Natrium core design and analysis team and is compliant with TerraPower procedures that implement regulatory requirements for software.

The Engineer will join the Nuclear Methods group, which is a geographically diverse team of nuclear engineers supporting neutronics methods development for the Natrium project. The group develops methods, models, and tools that support evaluating the performance of Natrium reactor core structures, systems, and components.

The ideal candidate possesses experience in both software development and multiphysics core analyses. Knowledge and experience with fast reactors physics is also preferred. In addition, experience with software quality assurance is preferred. As a lead the candidate should have experience in technical leadership and show a capacity to drive technical projects to completion.

Responsibilities

• Use configuration control software (i.e., Git) to develop, test, document, and maintain the Natrium core design and analysis software application

• Support coordination of release cycles using Jira to meet project milestones
