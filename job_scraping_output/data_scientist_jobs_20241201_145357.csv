We enable organizations of all sizes to easily build, scale, and run modern applications by helping them modernize legacy workloads, embrace innovation, and unleash AI. Our industry-leading developer data platform, MongoDB Atlas, is the only globally distributed, multi-cloud database and is available in more than 115 regions across AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. Atlas allows customers to build anywhere-on the edge, on premises, or across cloud providers. With offices worldwide and over 175,000 developers joining MongoDB every month, it's no wonder that leading organizations, like Samsung and Toyota, trust MongoDB to build next-generation, AI-powered applications.

MongoDB is seeking a Senior Software Engineer with advanced software engineering skills and experience in code modernization & building tools that can traverse code structures programmatically. Joining this team, you'll be pivotal in a product engineering group dedicated to helping users navigate code conversion challenges with AI's support.

We are seeking candidates located in North America for in-office, remote, or hybrid work options.

Many organizations have built up large estates of legacy applications. Lack of scalability and resilience, long development times, operating costs, and inability to run on the cloud are common issues with these applications. To address these issues, organizations are engaging in large transformational Application Modernization programs. MongoDB is recognized as the developer data platform of choice for transactional systems that provide the best scalability, resiliency, and developer experience in the cloud and on-premises. Organizations continuously migrate workloads from these legacy applications to new platforms, often based on microservices, using MongoDB.

Such transformations are very time-intensive and often risky. MongoDB is bolstering its team by creating tools that guide customers in transitioning their applications from relational databases to MongoDB. As businesses evolve their application development frameworks, they're increasingly drawn to the versatility of the document model. The Application Modernization team, already instrumental in this area, aids developers in making the shift from relational databases to MongoDB via Relational Migrator. Now, they're broadening their toolkit and are keen on modernizing code using a mix of AI and traditional text processing.
Our ideal candidate will have
5+ years of experience in Java in building large-scale enterprise applications
Proficiency in Javascript and familiarity with common database access patterns and frameworks in one or more languages
Knowledge of enterprise-scale software architectures, application development methodologies, and software deployment and operations

Experience in using and developing with MongoDB and JSON-based Document models is highly desirable
Experience with tools and methodologies for code analysis, refactoring, and automated testing
Problem-solving skills, including collaborating across disciplines and teams to devise creative solutions to technical and business challenges
Willingness to dive into a complex domain, ask the right questions, and bring new software tools and technologies to solve customer problems
Excellent communication skills (both spoken and written), within the team and in customer meetings
A good understanding of Generative AI concepts, tools, and services is a big plus, as is any experience building new applications/tools using Generative AI
A strong interest in how AI-supported toolchains can improve application development
Position Expectations
Execute a comprehensive code modernisation strategy that aligns transitioned code with cutting-edge practices

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope:

Classical thermodynamics is a fundamental discipline to model different engineering applications. The behavior of fluid and solid systems is described using Equation of States (EoS), used to model the relationship between pressure, volume, temperature and composition. For pure components, different EoS are reported in literature, using data coming from laboratory experiments, making the tuning problem irrelevant for most of the practical problems. Although, when we start model the behavior of component mixtures, especially hydrocarbons, the higher number of pure components and its isomers make it difficult or even impossible to model each component separately.

To tackle the problem of modeling mixtures with a large number of elements, techniques such as lumping and tuning are applied to reduce the real components to pseudo-component mixtures, trying to obtain similar thermodynamic behavior using a fraction of computational power. In this context, we can write the tuning as a data-assimilation problem and solve it by applying different methods.

During this internship, we are looking at the application of Ensemble Smoother methods to solving the tuning problem, incorporating the uncertainty on laboratory PVT experiments into EoS adjustments.

Deliverables:

The intern will work closely with the Intersect innovation team to implement and test the Ensemble Smoother code in Python. By the end of the internship the following technical deliverables are expected:

Implementation of Python plugin to communicate the Ensemble Smoother with the Fluid Modeler results
Testing different Equation-of-States (EOS) applications
Quantification of the uncertainty on laboratory PVT experiments
Showing the effectiveness of the new method with real laboratory data

Note that this is an innovation work, with the opportunity to publish it in a research journal.

Required Skills & Education:

Master Degree - (Penultimate or Final year) in Petroleum engineering, Chemistry Mathematics, Science Computing or a related discipline
Analysis and Statistics
Python code development
Non-linear optimization
Thermodynamics
Equation of state

We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.

Din rolle hos ABB vil dels være i vores digitale team, hvor du vil specificere, programmere, dokumentere og teste grænseflader mellem ABB-standardprodukter og tredjepartsprodukter, og dels i det mere traditionelle procesautomatiseringsfællesskab. Du vil deltage i alle projektfaser fra brainstorming af ideer til endelig installation og/eller konfiguration. Dit praktikforløb kommer til at handle om ABB's automationsløsning 800xA. Systemet er et Distributed Control System (DCS), der giver mulighed for både at indtænke sikkerhed og ikke mindst energioptimering på store anlæg. Med andre ord, er det noget, der virkelig gør en forskel inden for bæredygtig-hed, grøn omstilling samt beskyttelse mod fjendtlige hackerangreb på fx vandforsyningen. Mere konkret bruges systemet til at styre industriel produktion af bl.a. medicin og til distribution af alt fra elektricitet til naturgas. 800xA sørger også for varme og varmt vand hos både private og industrielle fjernvarmekunder. Mulighederne er utallige. Du kommer til at være med i opgaveløsningen fra start til slut med tilhørende kundedialog og test. Vores mål er klart. Du skal lære en masse og have en spændende hverdag, hvor du hele tiden udvikler dig på basis af interessante opgaver, og hvor din indsats gør en reel og målbar forskel. Ikke noget med at være kaffehenter eller kopislave. Efter endt praktik skal du have lært nok til at kunne indgå i teamet på helt lige fod med dine fastansatte kolleger. Går det, som vi håber, er dit praktikforløb første led i en tretrinsraket. Først praktik, dernæst hovedopgave i samarbejde med os og så direkte ud i en fast stilling. Du skal også vide, at ABB er din indgang til et utal af karrieremuligheder, uanset om du vil specialisere dig, skifte retning, gå ledervejen eller arbejde internationalt. Vi har kolleger, der er på deres 12. nye job i ABB. Vi har selvfølgelig et godt introprogram klar til dig, og du får fra første dag din egen mentor, som du kan sparre med. Du er ligeså selvfølgeligt med i alle vores sociale arrangementer. Det kan være alt fra fredagsøl med teamet til jule- og påskefrokost, oktoberfest, grillaftener og meget andet. Din nye arbejdsplads er ABB's kontor i Middelfart, hvor du bliver del af vores engineering-afdeling. Stemningen er god, og dine erfarne kolleger er altid klar til at hjælpe og sparre. Du har første dag omkring 1. februar 2025 og forløbet varer ca. et halvt år afhængigt af din uddannelse. Dine ansvarsområder: • Bidrage til igangværende udviklingsprojekter af desktop- eller web-applikationer, hvor dine evner inden for f.eks. C#, WPF, ASP.NET, Blazor eller SQL kan komme i spil • Tilsikre tilstrækkelig kvalitet gennem tests, jo mere automatiseret, des bedre • Benytte værktøjer såsom Azure DevOps / Git til samarbejde med resten af teamet • Installation og konfiguration af vore egne løsninger på kundens anlæg

Kvalifikationer til rollen

I gang med en teknisk uddannelse som ingeniør, datamatiker, IT-teknolog eller lignende
Stor lyst til at lære nyt og udvikle dine evner
Motivation for at få ansvar og modet til at prøve ting af på egen hånd - løbe med bolden
Mod til at opsøge de rigtige folk, hvis du mangler viden for at kunne løse en opgave
Evne for at planlægge, så du kan levere som aftalt/overholde deadlines
Forståelse for det nødvendige kvalitetsniveau - hvis en Fiat er nok, skal du ikke levere en Rolls Royce

Vi afholder samtaler løbende, så søg praktikken hurtigst muligt. Har du spørgsmål inden da, så kontakt meget gerne Digital Delivery Manager, Jesper Bolding på 2649 2940. Vi glæder os til at høre fra dig. Vi værdsætter mennesker med forskellige baggrunde. Kunne det her være din historie?

About Us

Thompson Engineering was formed in 1953 to provide quality assurance for construction projects related to industrial, infrastructure, and community development. As a drilling, materials testing, construction inspection, and chemistry laboratory firm, we supported the engineering and construction industry. Our early years were building blocks that allowed us to get our feet wet - literally - performing services along the Gulf Coast's rivers, bayous, and streams.

Today, Thompson Engineering is known for leadership on projects defining skylines, coastlines, and transportation lines. We support clients in the industrial, commercial, transportation, federal, and municipal markets. While we are still one of the first companies on project sites conducting environmental assessments, land surveys, and geotechnical studies, our design teams are close behind. We now deliver cutting-edge solutions to complex infrastructure and building requirements. And our project management and construction management services mean we are often one of the last teams to leave. From start to finish, we are a proven leader in the planning, design, and construction of major transportation, economic development, and waterfront projects across the Southeast.

They are exposed to cuts and bruises in using tools and working around moving machinery, strains while breaking or adding joints to drive shaft, slips and falls in wet weather, and the possibility of electric shock and burns. Some operators are subject to considerable discomfort due to mud, water, grease, and from the wearing of protective devices or equipment.
