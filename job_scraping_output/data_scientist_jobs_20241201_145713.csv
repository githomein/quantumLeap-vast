About the Role

Integer Technologies is currently hiring a Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager reporting to the Director of Mission Autonomy. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will serve as Principal Investigator (PI) on large, multi-year subsea data intelligence research programs with an emphasis on autonomous sense-making, and mission-driven use of subsea and oceanographic datasets. This role will lead the development of a decision support framework for uncrewed underwater vehicles capable of adapting in real time to changing environmental conditions. This includes maintaining the accuracy of subsea data collection and processing of that data at the edge as environmental conditions change. As part of this role, the Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will oversee the teams of engineers executing on these programs.

Many of our projects focus on using sensor-informed edge-deployed models running onboard uncrewed platforms (e.g., uncrewed surface vessels and uncrewed underwater vessels) to make real-time assessments of mission goals and provide the operators of uncrewed systems with decision aids to maximize mission outcomes. Executing this approach for maritime systems, which may involve multiple uncrewed or autonomous systems operating together to achieve a given mission, requires holistic system-wide modeling and simulation approach with a distillation of relevant factors correlated with mission outcomes. Therefore, we are particularly interested in candidates who have experience in extracting critical mission-relevant data from dense sources (e.g., modeling and simulation tools, sensors such as acoustic or magnetic, and/or machinery control systems) and translating that into actionable, mission-level information for autonomous decision making at the edge.

Integer is a science and technology research and development organization. As such, much of our work entails developing solutions for complex problems that presently have no known solutions. To achieve internal and customer project goals all candidates must be able to perform research, understand new concepts from other engineering disciplines on advanced and complex topics, and document findings in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager must be able to serve as a Principal Investigator and a technical contributor with the technical background to contribute to the development of new technologies and prototypes.

""Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.""

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die ""Idee Porsche"" hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das ""Etwas-mehr"" im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Project: Driving Carbon Neutrality through Advanced Geochemical Modeling and Machine Learning

About SLB:

We are a global technology company, driving energy innovation for a balanced planet. Together, we create amazing technology that unlocks access to energy for the benefit of all.

At SLB, we recognize that our innovation, creativity, and success stem from our differences. We actively recruit people with a diverse range of backgrounds and cultivate a culture of inclusion that unlocks the benefits of our diversity. We want to ensure that everyone feels a sense of belonging here and we encourage, enable, and empower our people to foster inclusivity, build trust, and demonstrate respect for all across the organization.

Global in outlook, local in practice - and with a united, shared passion for discovering solutions, we hire talented, driven people and support them to succeed, personally and professionally.

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope

The urgent quest for carbon neutrality requires innovative strategies for Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage (CCSU). Among these, Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) in depleted reservoirs and deep saline aquifers has garnered attention for its simplicity and reliability. However, its effective implementation requires addressing several challenges, particularly the efficient modeling of complex geochemical processes such as ionic trapping, mineral trapping, and mineral alteration/dissolution during CO2 injection.

While traditional geochemical modeling is well-established, it is computationally intensive. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML), we can develop surrogate models that significantly reduce computational costs. Although the application of ML in geochemistry is still emerging, it holds great promise for overcoming current limitations, especially when integrated with reservoir flow simulators.

Project Goals

Develop a Machine Learning (ML) Proxy Model: This project aims to create an ML-based proxy model to simulate the geochemical processes involved in typical CO2 underground storage applications.
Assess Viability in GCS Uncertainty Analysis: We will demonstrate the model's effectiveness in GCS uncertainty assessment, focusing on performance analysis during training and prediction phases.

Deliverables

Train Machine-Learning models for typical geochemistry phenomena that occur during CO2 storage
Conduct simulation studies to evaluate trained models in terms of accuracy and performance Deliverables
Deliver a ML proxy model for the relevant geochemistry of typical CO2 underground storage applications
Show surrogate model viability for GCS uncertainty assessment in a synthetic example

Required Skills & Qualifications

Studying for a Masters Degree - (Penultimate or Final year) in Mathematics; Engineering (Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Petroleum, or Computer); Computer Sciences or a related discipline
Machine Learning knowledge
Python & Tensorflow
Reservoir/Fluid Flow Simulation

We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.
