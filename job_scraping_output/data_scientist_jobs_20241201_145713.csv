What we do

Integer Technologies is an applied research and product development company founded by scientists and engineers with a passion for protecting freedom with innovation. We perform R&D on next-generation systems and technologies for the Department of Defense and other U.S. Government agencies. We are hardware and software developers with experience transforming research into fieldable technology. Our core portfolio of research includes projects in power & energy systems, unmanned systems (with an emphasis on maritime systems), digital engineering, cyber security, and advanced manufacturing. Our mission is to create a safer world by translating scientific discoveries into reliable products that address urgent national security needs... at the speed of relevance.

Company Benefits
Base salaries which exceed local & national industry averages.
Year-end performance-based bonuses.
401(k) with company matching that vest immediately.
Integer fully covers medical, prescription, vision, and dental insurance costs for the employee and dependents. Meaning Integer standard plan pays 100% of health insurance premiums for your entire family from a well-known national insurer, saving its employee's thousands of dollars annually.
Relocation assistance available.
Paid vacation, sick leave, and holidays.
Paid bereavement and parental leave.
Hybrid schedule: Mondays and Fridays are optional to work from home or in the office.

About the Role

Integer Technologies is currently hiring a Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager reporting to the Director of Mission Autonomy. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will serve as Principal Investigator (PI) on large, multi-year subsea data intelligence research programs with an emphasis on autonomous sense-making, and mission-driven use of subsea and oceanographic datasets. This role will lead the development of a decision support framework for uncrewed underwater vehicles capable of adapting in real time to changing environmental conditions. This includes maintaining the accuracy of subsea data collection and processing of that data at the edge as environmental conditions change. As part of this role, the Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will oversee the teams of engineers executing on these programs.

Many of our projects focus on using sensor-informed edge-deployed models running onboard uncrewed platforms (e.g., uncrewed surface vessels and uncrewed underwater vessels) to make real-time assessments of mission goals and provide the operators of uncrewed systems with decision aids to maximize mission outcomes. Executing this approach for maritime systems, which may involve multiple uncrewed or autonomous systems operating together to achieve a given mission, requires holistic system-wide modeling and simulation approach with a distillation of relevant factors correlated with mission outcomes. Therefore, we are particularly interested in candidates who have experience in extracting critical mission-relevant data from dense sources (e.g., modeling and simulation tools, sensors such as acoustic or magnetic, and/or machinery control systems) and translating that into actionable, mission-level information for autonomous decision making at the edge.

Integer is a science and technology research and development organization. As such, much of our work entails developing solutions for complex problems that presently have no known solutions. To achieve internal and customer project goals all candidates must be able to perform research, understand new concepts from other engineering disciplines on advanced and complex topics, and document findings in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager must be able to serve as a Principal Investigator and a technical contributor with the technical background to contribute to the development of new technologies and prototypes.

Primary Responsibilities
Serve as Principal Investigator (PI) for subsea data intelligence research programs, with an emphasis on edge processing of subsea data, including acoustic and magnetic, as well as autonomous decision making using processed data.
Be the lead authority responsible for maturing the science and technology research for the program into functional, demonstratable prototypes that address validated customer needs.
Oversee the technical, schedule, and budget performance for the S&T/R&D program and any related products that may be derived from it.
Establish a vision and plan for big picture project outcomes that align with the vision of the Director of Mission Autonomy.
Provide technical subject-matter expertise for the Company's projects related to undersea autonomy, subsea data collection, and edge processing of seafloor and oceanographic data.
Lead the development of sophisticated tools that enhance the ability of uncrewed and autonomous systems to conduct oceanographic and subsea data collection missions, including AI/ML tools, modeling and simulation suites, and optimization engines.
Lead the design of edge processing algorithms for subsea and oceanographic sensors including acoustic, magnetic, and electro-optic sensors.
Be the primary technical interface with Integer's academic research partners and serve as a liaison to government customers.
Manage, track, and review deliverables to federal customers. Ensure program deadlines are met and manage priorities for multiple programs.
Collaborate with federal sponsors to understand their missions, technology gaps, and success criteria.
Translate research into Navy relevant tools that meet specific mission requirements.
Serve as Site Lead for our Gulfport Mississippi office.
Manage all Gulfport office facilities related matters (Information Technology, building access, building security, office supplies, etc.) in coordination with relevant functional leads.
Lead engagements and maintain relationships with local partners and customers.
Identify marketing opportunities related to Gulfport office and contribute to marketing approach in collaboration with the Integer's Director of Marketing.
Manage local human resources activities (hiring, interviewing, timekeeping, etc.) in collaboration with Integer's Director of Human Resources.
Contribute to the financial planning and management of the Gulfport location in conjunction with Integer's Director of Finance.
Serve as Integer's Registered Agent for the State of Mississippi.
Lead, mentor, and manage a subsea data intelligence research and engineering group with various backgrounds and experience levels.
Provide support to other PI's when your direct reports are supporting programs other than the one for which you serve as PI. Help that PI understand the skill sets of your direct reports and identify appropriate levels of tasking for them.
Identify recruiting needs for your team, write detailed job descriptions, and lead interviews.
Translate research findings into, and contribute to, white papers and proposals for new subsea data intelligence research projects. Proactively approach potential sponsors of new research programs to send new undersea autonomy and data intelligence proposals.
Perform market analysis to identify unfilled market needs and work with the Director of Mission Autonomy to develop a roadmap for developing niche products and services that the subsea data intelligence research group can realistically develop.

Required Qualifications
Must be a U.S. Citizen with the ability to obtain and maintain a U.S. DoD Secret Clearance.
Bachelor's degree in a relevant field (e.g., mechanical engineering, ocean science/engineering, marine engineering, electrical engineering, or other related field) and 5+ years of experience relevant to the primary responsibilities outlined above.
Experience conducting research on topics related to oceanographic and/or seafloor sensors and data processing, artificial intelligence, edge computing underwater uncrewed vehicles (UUVs), mission-level autonomy and decision making, or other related topics.
An understanding of digital engineering, machine learning, system modeling and simulation tools, and how to apply those tools to oceanographic/subsea sensors and data processing. This includes leading the development of modeling and simulation environments to develop and demonstrate novel autonomous reasoning capabilities based on edge-processed subsea data.
A demonstrated understanding of the Navy's mission, capability gaps, and the ability to pursue new subsea data intelligence research projects to address these needs.
Familiarity with academic research environments and interfacing with early researchers and subject matter experts.
Experience leading and managing teams of researchers, tracking program milestones and schedule, and interfacing with federal sponsors.
Comfortable with modern software engineering practices such as version control.
