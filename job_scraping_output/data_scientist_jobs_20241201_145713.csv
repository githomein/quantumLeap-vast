About the Role

Integer Technologies is currently hiring a Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager reporting to the Director of Mission Autonomy. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will serve as Principal Investigator (PI) on large, multi-year subsea data intelligence research programs with an emphasis on autonomous sense-making, and mission-driven use of subsea and oceanographic datasets. This role will lead the development of a decision support framework for uncrewed underwater vehicles capable of adapting in real time to changing environmental conditions. This includes maintaining the accuracy of subsea data collection and processing of that data at the edge as environmental conditions change. As part of this role, the Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will oversee the teams of engineers executing on these programs.

Many of our projects focus on using sensor-informed edge-deployed models running onboard uncrewed platforms (e.g., uncrewed surface vessels and uncrewed underwater vessels) to make real-time assessments of mission goals and provide the operators of uncrewed systems with decision aids to maximize mission outcomes. Executing this approach for maritime systems, which may involve multiple uncrewed or autonomous systems operating together to achieve a given mission, requires holistic system-wide modeling and simulation approach with a distillation of relevant factors correlated with mission outcomes. Therefore, we are particularly interested in candidates who have experience in extracting critical mission-relevant data from dense sources (e.g., modeling and simulation tools, sensors such as acoustic or magnetic, and/or machinery control systems) and translating that into actionable, mission-level information for autonomous decision making at the edge.

Integer is a science and technology research and development organization. As such, much of our work entails developing solutions for complex problems that presently have no known solutions. To achieve internal and customer project goals all candidates must be able to perform research, understand new concepts from other engineering disciplines on advanced and complex topics, and document findings in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager must be able to serve as a Principal Investigator and a technical contributor with the technical background to contribute to the development of new technologies and prototypes.

""Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.""

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die ""Idee Porsche"" hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das ""Etwas-mehr"" im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

Project: Driving Carbon Neutrality through Advanced Geochemical Modeling and Machine Learning

About SLB:

We are a global technology company, driving energy innovation for a balanced planet. Together, we create amazing technology that unlocks access to energy for the benefit of all.

At SLB, we recognize that our innovation, creativity, and success stem from our differences. We actively recruit people with a diverse range of backgrounds and cultivate a culture of inclusion that unlocks the benefits of our diversity. We want to ensure that everyone feels a sense of belonging here and we encourage, enable, and empower our people to foster inclusivity, build trust, and demonstrate respect for all across the organization.

Global in outlook, local in practice - and with a united, shared passion for discovering solutions, we hire talented, driven people and support them to succeed, personally and professionally.

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope

The urgent quest for carbon neutrality requires innovative strategies for Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage (CCSU). Among these, Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) in depleted reservoirs and deep saline aquifers has garnered attention for its simplicity and reliability. However, its effective implementation requires addressing several challenges, particularly the efficient modeling of complex geochemical processes such as ionic trapping, mineral trapping, and mineral alteration/dissolution during CO2 injection.

While traditional geochemical modeling is well-established, it is computationally intensive. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML), we can develop surrogate models that significantly reduce computational costs. Although the application of ML in geochemistry is still emerging, it holds great promise for overcoming current limitations, especially when integrated with reservoir flow simulators.

Project Goals

Develop a Machine Learning (ML) Proxy Model: This project aims to create an ML-based proxy model to simulate the geochemical processes involved in typical CO2 underground storage applications.
Assess Viability in GCS Uncertainty Analysis: We will demonstrate the model's effectiveness in GCS uncertainty assessment, focusing on performance analysis during training and prediction phases.

Deliverables

Train Machine-Learning models for typical geochemistry phenomena that occur during CO2 storage
Conduct simulation studies to evaluate trained models in terms of accuracy and performance Deliverables
Deliver a ML proxy model for the relevant geochemistry of typical CO2 underground storage applications
Show surrogate model viability for GCS uncertainty assessment in a synthetic example

Required Skills & Qualifications

Studying for a Masters Degree - (Penultimate or Final year) in Mathematics; Engineering (Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Petroleum, or Computer); Computer Sciences or a related discipline
Machine Learning knowledge
Python & Tensorflow
Reservoir/Fluid Flow Simulation

We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope

The urgent quest for carbon neutrality requires innovative strategies for Carbon Capture, Usage, and Storage (CCSU). Among these, Geological Carbon Storage (GCS) in depleted reservoirs and deep saline aquifers has garnered attention for its simplicity and reliability. However, its effective implementation requires addressing several challenges, particularly the efficient modeling of complex geochemical processes such as ionic trapping, mineral trapping, and mineral alteration/dissolution during CO2 injection.

While traditional geochemical modeling is well-established, it is computationally intensive. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML), we can develop surrogate models that significantly reduce computational costs. Although the application of ML in geochemistry is still emerging, it holds great promise for overcoming current limitations, especially when integrated with reservoir flow simulators.

Project Goals

Develop a Machine Learning (ML) Proxy Model: This project aims to create an ML-based proxy model to simulate the geochemical processes involved in typical CO2 underground storage applications.
Assess Viability in GCS Uncertainty Analysis: We will demonstrate the model's effectiveness in GCS uncertainty assessment, focusing on performance analysis during training and prediction phases.

Deliverables

Train Machine-Learning models for typical geochemistry phenomena that occur during CO2 storage
Conduct simulation studies to evaluate trained models in terms of accuracy and performance Deliverables
Deliver a ML proxy model for the relevant geochemistry of typical CO2 underground storage applications
Show surrogate model viability for GCS uncertainty assessment in a synthetic example

Required Skills & Qualifications

Studying for a Masters Degree - (Penultimate or Final year) in Mathematics; Engineering (Civil, Mechanical, Chemical, Petroleum, or Computer); Computer Sciences or a related discipline
Machine Learning knowledge
Python & Tensorflow
Reservoir/Fluid Flow Simulation

We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.

Deep Learning for Image Classification and Generation: New Discoveries with Little Data

We are advertising a PhD position in the context of a large-scale national project:
HAICu: digital Humanities - Artificial Intelligence - Cultural heritage
This position is embedded in the Cognitive Science and AI department of Tilburg University in close collaboration with Naturalis Biodiversity Center.

The PhD project
Tilburg University and partners are seeking a candidate for a 4-year PhD position to investigate deep learning using sparse labels in cultural heritage data, as part of the national HAICu project. The project will be coordinated by Eric Postma (CSAI, Tilburg University), Anne Schulp (Naturalis/Utrecht University), and Dan Stowell (CSAI, Tilburg University/Naturalis). The project is interdisciplinary at the intersection of Deep Learning for Vision and Paleontology.

The focus of the PhD project will be on developing and evaluating existing and novel computer vision techniques for the automatic visual classification of paleontologic objects, i.e., fossil bones and bone fragments. Based on existing and newly acquired digitized data of bones and bone fragments, the PhD candidate will explore the latest AI algorithms for visual classification to overcome the main challenge: sparse data. For many bone fragments, only a few examples are available. Modern AI techniques can overcome such sparsity by imposing domain-specific constraints or by pretraining on related data. In addition, the candidate will explore generative algorithms to ""auto-complete"" bone fragments, offering context to the fossil discoveries by the citizen scientist community.

The candidate will be asked to:
Develop a specific research proposal within the proposed theme
Review the academic literature relevant to the project's goals
Carry out research, present your results, and author scientific articles on the above-mentioned topics
Collaborate with members of the project supervisors at Tilburg University, Naturalis, Utrecht University, and with the broader HAICu consortium, in particular with the other members of WP3 (see below)
Engage and collaborate with other researchers working on computer vision and paleontology research
Complete a PhD thesis written in English
Collaborate on outreach and public engagement activities
Gain teaching experience

Within the dynamic HAICu team, the PhD researcher will participate in Work Package 3 (WP3), entitled ""Learning from sparse examples"". In this WP, we collaborate with AI and machine learning experts from University of Groningen, Fontys University of Applied Sciences, and many other partners from the HAICu-wide community.

The HAICu Project
The HAICu project is a large-scale Dutch research project by universities and cultural-heritage institutions into new forms of Artificial Intelligence-based access to multimodal Cultural-Heritage data, both contemporary and historical. Within HAICu, AI researchers, Digital Humanities researchers and a wide range of public and private partners will co-develop scientific solutions to unlock the true societal potential of the current heterogeneous digital heritage collections. It will provide easier, richer and more reliable data access to citizens, journalists, civic organisations, and various other stakeholders.

HAICu is funded by the NWO National Science Agenda (NWA) and has a budget of about EUR 10 million. HAICu started in January 2024 and will last 6 years (until Jan 2030).

For more information about HAICu, please see https://www.haicu.science/
