Join our affiliate TotalEnergies EP Denmark AS in Esbjerg !

You will join the Digital Transformation and Innovation team at TotalEnergies Denmark, based in Esbjerg. The team's primary mission is to identify opportunities for developing digital solutions through advanced data exploration, prototyping, and, depending on the projects, the development of MVPs or transfer to the Total Digital Factory. The team covers a wide range of domains, including production optimization, carbon footprint reduction, safety, and environmental and industrial performance. The activities span offshore operations, maintenance logistics, interventions on wells and installations, mobilizing hundreds of people in one of the most complex offshore oil plants in the North Sea. The stated goal is to develop and deploy ambitious solutions (prescriptive rather than descriptive) from data exploration to the development of apps and solutions in collaboration with users. For the specific position in question, the initial focus will be on understanding the causes and minimizing production losses, particularly related to valve failures, using real-time time series data. Several ongoing use cases within the team in the field of operational performance leverage GenAI components (including Azure OpenAI) and NLP. These efforts aim to enrich datasets and will likely lead to new developments. In addition to maintaining some of the use cases in production, this role provides an opportunity to delve into extremely varied topics and explore equally diverse techniques

As a data scientist in the industrial domain, the main tasks will be as follows :
• Advanced feature engineering and modeling for optimization studies (identifying points of industrial performance and costs) ;
• Exploratory analysis and development of use cases in collaboration with subject matter experts ;
• Analysis studies based on the developed models or enriched data ;
• Whenever applicable, implementation of proof-of-concept applications on themes with high potential. The development/data engineering team usually intervenes at this stage, but it is common for comprehensive profiles to enhance their own experience by taking a significant part or even leadership in this area
• Technology stacks: Primarily Python with Dash/Plotly or a combination of Python and React JS, in an Azure and/or server environment. You will have to build upon the proofs of concept already initiated on these themes by the VIE (Volunteer for International Experience) whom you will replace, before developing or participating in the creation of new proofs of concept.

Project: Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Numerical Simulation

About SLB:

We are a global technology company, driving energy innovation for a balanced planet. Together, we create amazing technology that unlocks access to energy for the benefit of all.

At SLB, we recognize that our innovation, creativity, and success stem from our differences. We actively recruit people with a diverse range of backgrounds and cultivate a culture of inclusion that unlocks the benefits of our diversity. We want to ensure that everyone feels a sense of belonging here and we encourage, enable, and empower our people to foster inclusivity, build trust, and demonstrate respect for all across the organization.

Global in outlook, local in practice - and with a united, shared passion for discovering solutions, we hire talented, driven people and support them to succeed, personally and professionally.

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope

Numerical simulation remains the only reliable method to solve partial differential equations to predict future states of a complex physical system - be it weather, fluid flow, quantum dynamics or orbital mechanics. SLB's state-of-the-art reservoir simulator is used to model such a fluid flow in porous media for various applications, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and geothermal energy systems. The drawback of traditional numerical methods, however, is that they are computational very intensive and are not practical for many realistic workflows.

In this project, you will work on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to predict how a reservoir system behaves when CO2 is injected into it. Machine Learning models have provably been shown to run orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulators and, once trained, provide a promising alternative or enhancement to traditional solvers. The ultimate goal is to use the developed machine learning model to find optimal locations and volumes of CO2 to inject into a subsurface in order to maximize carbon storage and accelerate the global push towards Net-zero.

Deliverables

As part of the Numerical Simulation team, you will work on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to solve Partial Differential Equations on general grids and geometries. You will have access to high-fidelity 3D simulator data to develop and train novel Neural Operator and Graph Neural Network architectures. You will also be integrating this model into full workflows to show that ML solutions run orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods and will have the opportunity to publish in top-tier ML and Applied Mathematics conferences/journals (ICML, NeurIPs, ICLR etc.)

Required Skills & Qualifications

Studying for a Masters or PhD in Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Computer Science or a related discipline
Theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning and deep learning
Strong programming skills and experience with one of Scikit/PyTorch/Tensorflow etc.
Ability to quickly understand and implement models from research papers

Experience in one of the following would be advantageous

Neural Operators, DeepONets or Graph Neural Networks etc
Knowledge of mass conservation equations and material balance
Simulation basics (numerical methods for solving PDE systems)

We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.
