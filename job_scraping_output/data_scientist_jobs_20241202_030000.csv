Global in outlook, local in practice - and with a united, shared passion for discovering solutions, we hire talented, driven people and support them to succeed, personally and professionally.

Location:

Abingdon, Oxfordshire

Description & Scope

Numerical simulation remains the only reliable method to solve partial differential equations to predict future states of a complex physical system - be it weather, fluid flow, quantum dynamics or orbital mechanics. SLB's state-of-the-art reservoir simulator is used to model such a fluid flow in porous media for various applications, including Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and geothermal energy systems. The drawback of traditional numerical methods, however, is that they are computational very intensive and are not practical for many realistic workflows.

In this project, you will work on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to predict how a reservoir system behaves when CO2 is injected into it. Machine Learning models have provably been shown to run orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulators and, once trained, provide a promising alternative or enhancement to traditional solvers. The ultimate goal is to use the developed machine learning model to find optimal locations and volumes of CO2 to inject into a subsurface in order to maximize carbon storage and accelerate the global push towards Net-zero.

Deliverables

As part of the Numerical Simulation team, you will work on developing a physics-informed machine learning model to solve Partial Differential Equations on general grids and geometries. You will have access to high-fidelity 3D simulator data to develop and train novel Neural Operator and Graph Neural Network architectures. You will also be integrating this model into full workflows to show that ML solutions run orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods and will have the opportunity to publish in top-tier ML and Applied Mathematics conferences/journals (ICML, NeurIPs, ICLR etc.)

Required Skills & Qualifications

Studying for a Masters or PhD in Machine Learning, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Computer Science or a related discipline
Theoretical and practical knowledge in machine learning and deep learning
Strong programming skills and experience with one of Scikit/PyTorch/Tensorflow etc.
Ability to quickly understand and implement models from research papers

Experience in one of the following would be advantageous

Neural Operators, DeepONets or Graph Neural Networks etc
Knowledge of mass conservation equations and material balance
Simulation basics (numerical methods for solving PDE systems)

We are open to flexible, hybrid working with a combination of on-site & home working days.

""Am Anfang schaute ich mich um, konnte aber den Wagen, von dem ich träumte, nicht finden. Also beschloss ich, ihn mir selbst zu bauen.""

Dieser Satz von Ferry Porsche bringt alles auf den Punkt, was Porsche ausmacht. Als Marke, als Unternehmen, als Automobilhersteller, als Arbeitgeber. Die ""Idee Porsche"" hat so einzigartige Sportwagen wie den Porsche 356 oder den 911 hervorgebracht. Durch die Kombination von Tradition und Innovation mit den Porsche typischen, manchmal etwas unkonventionellen Denkweisen unserer Mitarbeiter, lassen wir automobile Träume wahr werden und haben so immer das ""Etwas-mehr"" im Blick. Porsche ist allerdings viel mehr als ""nur"" ein exklusiver Sportwagenhersteller. Denn auch als Arbeitgeber hat Porsche viel zu bieten: vielfältige Einstiegs- und Karrieremöglichkeiten, Maßnahmen zur Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie sowie flexible Arbeitszeitmodelle.

About the Role

Integer Technologies is currently hiring a Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager reporting to the Director of Mission Autonomy. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will serve as Principal Investigator (PI) on large, multi-year subsea data intelligence research programs with an emphasis on autonomous sense-making, and mission-driven use of subsea and oceanographic datasets. This role will lead the development of a decision support framework for uncrewed underwater vehicles capable of adapting in real time to changing environmental conditions. This includes maintaining the accuracy of subsea data collection and processing of that data at the edge as environmental conditions change. As part of this role, the Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager will oversee the teams of engineers executing on these programs.

Many of our projects focus on using sensor-informed edge-deployed models running onboard uncrewed platforms (e.g., uncrewed surface vessels and uncrewed underwater vessels) to make real-time assessments of mission goals and provide the operators of uncrewed systems with decision aids to maximize mission outcomes. Executing this approach for maritime systems, which may involve multiple uncrewed or autonomous systems operating together to achieve a given mission, requires holistic system-wide modeling and simulation approach with a distillation of relevant factors correlated with mission outcomes. Therefore, we are particularly interested in candidates who have experience in extracting critical mission-relevant data from dense sources (e.g., modeling and simulation tools, sensors such as acoustic or magnetic, and/or machinery control systems) and translating that into actionable, mission-level information for autonomous decision making at the edge.

Integer is a science and technology research and development organization. As such, much of our work entails developing solutions for complex problems that presently have no known solutions. To achieve internal and customer project goals all candidates must be able to perform research, understand new concepts from other engineering disciplines on advanced and complex topics, and document findings in a way that is easy for non-experts to understand. The Subsea Data Intelligence Engineering Manager must be able to serve as a Principal Investigator and a technical contributor with the technical background to contribute to the development of new technologies and prototypes.

Primary Responsibilities
Serve as Principal Investigator (PI) for subsea data intelligence research programs, with an emphasis on edge processing of subsea data, including acoustic and magnetic, as well as autonomous decision making using processed data.
Be the lead authority responsible for maturing the science and technology research for the program into functional, demonstratable prototypes that address validated customer needs.
Oversee the technical, schedule, and budget performance for the S&T/R&D program and any related products that may be derived from it.
Establish a vision and plan for big picture project outcomes that align with the vision of the Director of Mission Autonomy.
Provide technical subject-matter expertise for the Company's projects related to undersea autonomy, subsea data collection, and edge processing of seafloor and oceanographic data.
Lead the development of sophisticated tools that enhance the ability of uncrewed and autonomous systems to conduct oceanographic and subsea data collection missions, including AI/ML tools, modeling and simulation suites, and optimization engines.
Lead the design of edge processing algorithms for subsea and oceanographic sensors including acoustic, magnetic, and electro-optic sensors.
Be the primary technical interface with Integer's academic research partners and serve as a liaison to government customers.
Manage, track, and review deliverables to federal customers. Ensure program deadlines are met and manage priorities for multiple programs.
Collaborate with federal sponsors to understand their missions, technology gaps, and success criteria.
Translate research into Navy relevant tools that meet specific mission requirements.
Serve as Site Lead for our Gulfport Mississippi office.
Manage all Gulfport office facilities related matters (Information Technology, building access, building security, office supplies, etc.) in coordination with relevant functional leads.
Lead engagements and maintain relationships with local partners and customers.
Identify marketing opportunities related to Gulfport office and contribute to marketing approach in collaboration with the Integer's Director of Marketing.
Manage local human resources activities (hiring, interviewing, timekeeping, etc.) in collaboration with Integer's Director of Human Resources.
Contribute to the financial planning and management of the Gulfport location in conjunction with Integer's Director of Finance.
Serve as Integer's Registered Agent for the State of Mississippi.
Lead, mentor, and manage a subsea data intelligence research and engineering group with various backgrounds and experience levels.

Deep Learning for Image Classification and Generation: New Discoveries with Little Data

We are advertising a PhD position in the context of a large-scale national project:
HAICu: digital Humanities - Artificial Intelligence - Cultural heritage
This position is embedded in the Cognitive Science and AI department of Tilburg University in close collaboration with Naturalis Biodiversity Center.

The PhD project
Tilburg University and partners are seeking a candidate for a 4-year PhD position to investigate deep learning using sparse labels in cultural heritage data, as part of the national HAICu project. The project will be coordinated by Eric Postma (CSAI, Tilburg University), Anne Schulp (Naturalis/Utrecht University), and Dan Stowell (CSAI, Tilburg University/Naturalis). The project is interdisciplinary at the intersection of Deep Learning for Vision and Paleontology.

The focus of the PhD project will be on developing and evaluating existing and novel computer vision techniques for the automatic visual classification of paleontologic objects, i.e., fossil bones and bone fragments. Based on existing and newly acquired digitized data of bones and bone fragments, the PhD candidate will explore the latest AI algorithms for visual classification to overcome the main challenge: sparse data. For many bone fragments, only a few examples are available. Modern AI techniques can overcome such sparsity by imposing domain-specific constraints or by pretraining on related data. In addition, the candidate will explore generative algorithms to ""auto-complete"" bone fragments, offering context to the fossil discoveries by the citizen scientist community.

The candidate will be asked to:
Develop a specific research proposal within the proposed theme
Review the academic literature relevant to the project's goals
Carry out research, present your results, and author scientific articles on the above-mentioned topics
Collaborate with members of the project supervisors at Tilburg University, Naturalis, Utrecht University, and with the broader HAICu consortium, in particular with the other members of WP3 (see below)
Engage and collaborate with other researchers working on computer vision and paleontology research
Complete a PhD thesis written in English
Collaborate on outreach and public engagement activities
Gain teaching experience

Within the dynamic HAICu team, the PhD researcher will participate in Work Package 3 (WP3), entitled ""Learning from sparse examples"". In this WP, we collaborate with AI and machine learning experts from University of Groningen, Fontys University of Applied Sciences, and many other partners from the HAICu-wide community.

The HAICu Project
The HAICu project is a large-scale Dutch research project by universities and cultural-heritage institutions into new forms of Artificial Intelligence-based access to multimodal Cultural-Heritage data, both contemporary and historical. Within HAICu, AI researchers, Digital Humanities researchers and a wide range of public and private partners will co-develop scientific solutions to unlock the true societal potential of the current heterogeneous digital heritage collections. It will provide easier, richer and more reliable data access to citizens, journalists, civic organisations, and various other stakeholders.

HAICu is funded by the NWO National Science Agenda (NWA) and has a budget of about EUR 10 million. HAICu started in January 2024 and will last 6 years (until Jan 2030).

For more information about HAICu, please see https://www.haicu.science/
