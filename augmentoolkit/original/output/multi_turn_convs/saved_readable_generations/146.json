Could you explain the significance of Isis's words and actions in the passage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Isis is portrayed as a wise figure who uses her knowledge to help Rê. She recognizes that a worm has brought sorrow to Rê and asks for his name, believing that knowing his true name will help heal him. Her words and actions are significant because they demonstrate Isis's ability to use her wisdom and understanding to bring about healing and banish sorrow. Isis's actions are not just about physical healing but also about restoring Rê's well-being on a deeper level.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Why does Isis insist that Rê reveal his true name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIsis insists that Rê reveal his true name because she believes that the power of a name can cure illness and bring life. She tells Rê that the poison will leave him only if he speaks his true name, as the one whose name is spoken will live. This belief is rooted in ancient Egyptian mythology, where the name was considered a powerful force that could control the essence of a person or deity.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens after Rê decides to speak his true name?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAfter Rê decides to speak his true name, he is approximately healed, but he has lost his power. As a result, he retreats to the heavenly cow, indicating a significant loss of his previous authority and control over the universe. This outcome suggests that Rê's power and influence are closely tied to his name and that the act of revealing it has stripped him of some of his divine attributes."}
