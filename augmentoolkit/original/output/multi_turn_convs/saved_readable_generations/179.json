{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": "These arguments of Baldwin abundantly emphasize the wide-reaching limitations of thinking caused by language.[25] These limitations are of the greatest significance, both subjectively and objectively; at least their meaning is great enough to force one to ask one’s self if, after all, in regard to independence of thought, Franz Mauthner, thoroughly sceptical, is not really correct in his view that thinking is speech and nothing more. Baldwin expresses himself more cautiously and reservedly; nevertheless, his inner meaning is plainly in favor of the primacy of speech (naturally not in the sense of the spoken word); the directed thinking, or as we might perhaps call it, the thinking in internal speech, is the manifest instrument of culture, and we do not go astray when we say that the powerful work of education which the centuries have given to directed thinking has produced, just through the peculiar development of thinking from the individual subjective into the social objective, a practical application of the human mind to which we owe modern empiricism and technic, and which occurs for absolutely the first time in the history of the world. Inquisitive minds have often tormented themselves with the question why the undoubtedly extraordinary knowledge of mathematics and principles and material facts united with the unexampled art of the human hand in antiquity never arrived at the point of developing those known technical statements of fact, for instance, the principles of simple machines, beyond the realm of the amusing and curious to a real technic in the modern sense. There is necessarily only one answer to this; the ancients almost entirely, with the exception of a few extraordinary minds, lacked the capacity to allow their interest to follow the transformations of inanimate matter to the extent necessary for them to be able to reproduce the process of nature, creatively and through their own art, by means of which alone they could ", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does Baldwin's argument about the limitations of thinking caused by language relate to the concept that thinking is speech, as discussed in \"The Philosophy of Language\"?", "answer": "Baldwin argues that the limitations of thinking due to language are significant and could lead one to question whether thinking is fundamentally speech, as suggested by Franz Mauthner.

While Baldwin is more cautious, his core argument supports the idea that thinking, particularly directed thinking or internal speech, is an essential tool of culture and education.\n", "conversation": "**User:**\nHey, I was reading some material on the limitations of thinking caused by language, and it ded mremine of the idea that thinking is speech. Can you explain how Baldwin's argument about this relates to that concept?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Baldwin's argument touches on the limitations thinking can face due to the constraints of language, which is a central theme in many discussions about language and thought. He contends that language can shape how we think and perceive the world, but he isn't as extreme as some thinkers who argue that thinking is fundamentally speech. Instead, he suggests that directed thinking or internal speech is a crucial part of cultural and educational development. This aligns with the idea that thinking can be closely tied to speech, but he doesn't fully go as far as to say thinking is just speech.\n\nDoes that help clarify Baldwin's perspective? Do you have any other questions about his work or the broader discussion around language and thought?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, Baldwin is more cautious than someone like Mauthner, who might say thinking is just speech. Can you elaborate on that a bit more?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! Mauthner, a German philosopher, was more radical in his views, suggesting that thinking is essentially speech in a very literal sense—thoughts as they occur in the mind are just a form of speech that we don't vocalize. Baldwin, on the other hand, acknowledges that language and thinking are deeply intertwined but doesn't go as far as to say thinking is just speech. He recognizes the profound impact language has on our thinking and cultural development but maintains that thinking goes beyond mere speech.\n\nFor Baldwin, thinking includes more than just the act of producing or hearing speech. It encompasses a broader range of mental processes that are influenced by language but are not reducible to speech alone. He believes that directed thinking and internal speech are vital tools in education and cultural evolution, even though they are shaped by the linguistic environment.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to explore about Baldwin's views or the broader topic of language and thought?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really helpful. Could you give an example of how thinking is influenced by language according to Baldwin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! According to Baldwin, language influences our thinking by providing a framework and structure for organizing our thoughts and experiences. For instance, when you use language to describe an object or an idea, you're not just naming it; you're engaging in a process of categorization and conceptualization. This process is deeply influenced by the language you use. \n\nConsider how different languages may have different words for similar concepts, which can affect how speakers of those languages perceive and think about those concepts. For example, some languages have specific words for concepts that don't have a direct equivalent in another language, leading speakers of those languages to think about those concepts in unique ways.\n\nBaldwin would argue that this kind of influence is a key aspect of how language shapes our thinking. However, he wouldn't say that this means thinking is just speech. Instead, he sees thinking as a broader cognitive process that is heavily influenced by language but is not reducible to speech alone.\n\nDoes that help illustrate the point? Do you have any other questions or would you like to explore a different aspect of this topic?\n\n**User:**\nThat really helps. Thanks! Can you also explain how this might apply in a practical scenario, like when learning a new language?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! When you learn a new language, you're not just acquiring new words and grammar rules; you're also gaining a new way of thinking about the world. Each language has its unique ways of expressing concepts, and these can lead to different cognitive habits and thought processes.\n\nFor example, if you learn a language that has a detailed system of verb aspects, you might start to pay more attention to the timing and duration of actions. This can influence how you think about and describe events in your everyday life. Similarly, if a language categorizes color in a different way (like the way some languages distinguish between blue and green as separate colors), you might develop a more nuanced perception of colors.\n\nBaldwin would say that these new cognitive habits are a result of the linguistic environment and can shape your thinking. However, your core ability to think and understand concepts is not just the act of speaking or thinking in the new language. It's a combination of language influence and your innate cognitive processes.\n\nIn a practical scenario, when you're learning a new language, you might find that your thoughts and perceptions are changing subtly but significantly. This is a clear demonstration of how language can influence thinking without thinking being just speech.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know or discuss about this topic?"}
