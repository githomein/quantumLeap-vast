According to the author, what is the underlying reason for the difficulty in considering others' needs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe author suggests that the underlying reason for the difficulty in considering others' needs is an inner resistance in nature itself that forces man to include others in his scheme, to prevent his own greedy desires from destroying him. This inner pull is a fundamental aspect of human existence, but it often conflicts with external ideals. Does that help clarify the author's point? Do you have any other questions about the text?\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful. Moving on, how does the author view the progress of understanding the importance of considering others?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe author observes that, despite an inner demand and ethical and moral teachings over the centuries, man has only very imperfectly learned that it is in his own interest to consider his neighbor and that it is impossible for him to ignore the needs of the body social of which he is a part. The author notes that this knowledge has not been fully realized, indicating that there is still much work to be done.\n\n**User:**\nInteresting. What is the external objection to the idea of self-striving and selfish seeking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExternally, the recognition of the strength of the ego impulse is objected to because of the ideal conception that self-striving and so-called selfish seeking are unworthy, ignoble, and incompatible with a desirable character, and they must be ignored at all costs. This external ideal often places a moral burden on individuals to suppress their self-interest, which can create a conflict with the natural inclination to consider others.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does the author reconcile the inner demand for considering others with the external ideal of self-striving and selfish seeking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe author acknowledges that there is an inner demand for considering others, but the external ideal often portraying self-striving and selfish seeking as unworthy and ignoble poses a challenge. The author suggests that this internal conflict makes it difficult for individuals to practice ethical and moral behavior that considers the needs of others. The author implies that finding a balance between these two opposing forces is essential for true understanding and action. Does that help clarify the author's perspective?"}
