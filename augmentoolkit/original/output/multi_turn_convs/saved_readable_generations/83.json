Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! As the individual grows and develops, the libido adapts by creating new avenues for satisfying its need for activity and satisfaction. It shifts from the primary model of rhythmic activity in the nutritional zone to the zone of other functions, with sexuality as its final goal. This process involves a considerable part of the \"hunger libido\" transforming into the \"sexual libido.\"\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds interesting. According to Freud's theory, what are the two periods that distinguish this transition from the nutritional zone to the sexual function?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure! Two periods are distinguished in this state of transition: the epoch of suckling and the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity. During the epoch of suckling, the function of nutrition remains, but it transitions to rhythmic activity with pleasure and satisfaction as a goal, without the taking of nourishment. In the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity, the hand becomes a more prominent auxiliary organ, and the gaining of pleasure shifts from the mouth zone to other regions.\n\n**User:**\nCan you tell me more about the changes that occur in the activity expressed in other regions of the body during the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! During the epoch of the displaced rhythmic activity, the activity expressed in other regions of the body becomes more varied and complex. It can appear as rubbing, boring, picking, and other rhythmic activities that serve to produce pleasure. These activities focus on different openings of the body and specific portions of the skin. This shift helps to lay the groundwork for later sexual development. Does that help clarify it for you?"}
