Can you help me understand what it means?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! In \"The Golden Ass,\" the horse is positioned between two sacrificial vessels, one from which it comes and another to which it returns. This positioning mirrors the journey of the sun from morning to evening. Symbolically, these vessels represent the producing and devouring mother, suggesting that the horse signifies the libido that has entered the world. This positioning hints at life enclosed within an ovum, emphasizing the cycle of life and destruction. Does that help clarify the symbolism for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now, I also came across the Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 3: 3, which seems to have some connection to the sacrifices mentioned in the text. Could you explain what it suggests?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! The Brihadâranyaka-Upanishad 3: 3 supports the idea that the repeated sacrifice of the libido, which once belonged to the mother, leads to a state of introversion similar to the one before the creation of the world. The vessels surrounding the horse in the text are meant to symbolize this enclosed life, reinforcing the idea that the sacrifices contribute to a cycle of creation and destruction.

Could you explain further how the horse is related to the concept of libido and the mother in the text?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! The horse is closely associated with the concept of libido and the mother. It is noted that the horse must be sacrificed to produce the world, and similarly, the sacrifice of the horse can only produce another state of introversion. This association is further supported by the horse's manifold connections with the mother, indicating its symbolic role in representing the libido that has entered the world. Does this provide a clearer understanding of the horse's symbolic importance in the text?"}
