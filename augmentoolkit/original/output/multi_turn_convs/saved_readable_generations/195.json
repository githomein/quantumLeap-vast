{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": "Hölderlin exemplifies this path in his poetry and his life. I leave the poet to speak in his song:_To the Rose._“In the Mother-womb eternal,          Sweetest queen of every lea,         Still the living and supernal          Nature carries thee and me.“Little rose, the storm’s fierce power          Strips our leaves and alters us;         Yet the deathless germ will tower          To new blooms, miraculous.”The following comments may be made upon the parable of this poem: The rose is the symbol of the beloved woman (“Haidenröslein,” heather rose of Goethe). The rose blooms in the “rose-garden” of the maiden; therefore, it is also a direct symbol of the libido. When the poet dreams that he is with the rose in the mother-womb of nature, then, psychologically, the fact is that his libido is with the mother. Here is an eternal germination and renewal. We have come across this motive already in the Hierosgamos hymn (Iliad XIV): The nuptials in the blessed West; that is to say, the union in and with the mother. Plutarch shows us this motive in naïve form in his tradition of the Osiris myth; Osiris and Isis copulating in the mother’s womb. This is also perceived by Hölderlin as the enviable prerogative of the gods—to enjoy everlasting infancy. Thus, in Hyperion, he says:“Fateless, like the sleeping nursling,         Breathe the Heavenly ones;         Chastely guarded in modest buds,         Their spirits blossom eternally,         And their quiet eyes         Gaze out in placid         Eternal serenity.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the symbol used in Hölderlin's poem \"_To the Rose_\" and what does it represent?", "answer": "The symbol used in Hölderlin's poem \"_To the Rose_\" is the rose, which represents the beloved woman.
