Could you explain why this revision is necessary?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The primary reason for revising the descriptive psychologic conception of libido is to apply the libido theory more effectively to dementia præcox. The author argues that the current understanding of libido isn't sufficient to fully comprehend and utilize the theory in this context. Essentially, they are suggesting that we need to update our view on libido to better align with the realities of dementia præcox.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. The passage also mentions a principle regarding the replacement of disturbed functions of reality. Could you explain what this principle is?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! The author identifies a principle concerning the replacement of a disturbed function of reality. According to this principle, when a function of reality is disturbed and ceases to be effective, it is replaced by a previously existing mode of adaptation. This principle is particularly evident in the doctrines of the neuroses, where a recent repression that fails is often replaced by an older, established pattern of behavior or thought. This helps explain how psychological mechanisms can shift and adapt in response to disruptions."}
