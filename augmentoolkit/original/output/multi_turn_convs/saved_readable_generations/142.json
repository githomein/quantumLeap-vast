Could you explain that connection in more detail?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! According to the text, speech is said to have originated from the impulse that was repressed into the presexual stage and turned towards the external world. This suggests that speech thinking, which involves conscious activity directed towards the external world, began at this moment. Essentially, the impulse that was originally focused internally during the presexual stage was redirected outward, leading to the development of speech. Does this help clarify the concept for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Can you explain how the passage supports the idea that speech is linked to external objects?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! The text supports this idea by stating that language might have originated when the impulse, repressed into the presexual stage, turned to the external world in order to find an equivalent object there. This implies that speech thinking, which is conscious activity directed towards the external world, is linked to the origin of language. Essentially, the repressed impulse needed a way to externalize its focus, leading to the development of speech as a means to communicate and interact with the external world. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this connection?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also came across a reference to the Aitareyopanishad. Could you tell me what it says about the development of speech and fire?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The Aitareyopanishad describes speech emerging from the mouth, likening it to an egg hatched by brooding. It also states that fire entered man through the mouth, indicating a connection between speech and fire. This intimate connection suggests that both speech and fire are integral to human development and existence, as they both emerge from the mouth. This text provides a rich context for understanding the symbolic and developmental importance of these elements in ancient thought. Does that help clarify the perspective on speech and fire according to the Aitareyopanishad?"}
