With her hands Isis kneaded that and the soil      Which was about it, together:      From that she created a venerable worm,      And made him like a spear.

Could you help me understand what the poetical description suggests about the worm and its actions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The poetical description in the hymn suggests that Isis crafted a worm from the spittle of the ancient God. She then threw this worm coiled upon the path. When the great God Rê roamed through his lands, the worm stung him, causing Rê to lose his voice, chattering his jaws, and trembling with fear as the venom spread through his body. This scene paints a vivid picture of how the worm, created from divine spittle, symbolizes a powerful and potentially dangerous force.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now, I also came across a hymn called \"The Mother and Fear,\" and there's a mention of a serpent. Could you explain what the serpent signifies in this hymn and how it relates to the theme of fear and the mother?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! In the hymn \"The Mother and Fear,\" the serpent symbolizes fear itself. It represents the primitive, instinctual fear that arises from the unknown and the fear of mortality. The serpent is a powerful symbol that illustrates the human tendency to seek reassurance from the mother fre, iguwho is seen as the source of comfort and security in times of need.\n\nIn the context of the hymn, the serpent is associated with the repressed desire to return to the mother, a concept that reflects the deep-seated psychological and emotional ties we have to our mothers. Additionally, the mother in the hymn is portrayed as a powerful figure who has the ability to heal, even from the brink of death. This is evident when she cures the divine God Rê, who is sick unto death. The serpent, therefore, serves as a symbol of the fear of death and the longing for the safety and security provided by the mother."}
