The text suggests that ancient people were m focusoreed on æsthetically adapting their subjective phantasies and expectations rather than grasping the \"how\" of the real world in an objective and exact manner. In contrast, modern people tend to experience a sense of coldness and disillusion, as exemplified by the works of Giordano Bruno and Johannes Kepler. It seems to highlight a shift in priorities from the subjective and imaginative to the objective and scientific.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Can you elaborate on what the text says about the role of mythology in ancient culture?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! The text implies that the energy and interest that ancient people invested in science and technic were largely directed toward their mythology. This mythology was not just a collection of stories, but a vast, ever-evolving system of beliefs, transformations, and new syncretistic groupings. It was characterized by kaleidoscopic changes, constant phantasies that shaped both plastic and shadowy forms, all stemming from an inner, subjective source rather than an objective reality. This intense focus on mythology reflects a deeper engagement with the imaginative and symbolic aspects of their culture."}
