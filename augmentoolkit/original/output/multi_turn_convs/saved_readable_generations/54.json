Thus near Eleusis there was an abyss, through which Aidoneus passed up and down, when he kidnapped Cora. (Dragon and maiden: the libido overcome by resistance, life replaced by death.) There were crevices in the rocks, through which souls could ascend to the upper world. Behind the temple of Chthonia in Hermione lay a sacred district of Pluto, with a ravine through which Hercules had brought up Cerberus; in addition, there was an “Acherusian” lake.[710] This ravine was, therefore, the entrance to the place where death was conquered. The lake also belongs here as a further mother symbol, for symbols appear massed together, as they are surrogates, and, therefore, do not afford the same satisfaction of desire as accorded by reality, so that the unsatisfied remnant of the libido must seek still further symbolic outlets. The ravine in the Areopagus in Athens was considered the seat of inhabitants of the lower world. An old Grecian custom[711] suggests a similar idea. Girls were sent into a cavern, where a poisonous snake dwelt, as a test of virginity. If they were bitten by the snake, it was a token that they were no longer chaste. We find this same motive again in the Roman legend of St. Silvester, at the end of the fifth century:[712]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How do the ravines and caves in ancient Greek mythology symbolize the concept of the lower world or underworld?", "answer": "Ravines and caves in ancient Greek mythology symbolize the lower world or underworld because they represent passages or entrances to the realm of the dead.

I'm curious about how ravines and caves in ancient Greek mythology symbolize the concept of the lower world or underworld. Could you explain that a bit more?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! In ancient Greek mythology, ravines and caves symbolize the lower world or underworld because they represent passages or entrances to the realm of the dead. These natural formations were believed to be gateways through which the souls of the deceased could ascend or descend, connecting the living world with the underworld. For example, the famous cave of Hades, known as Tartarus, was considered a portal to the underworld. Does this help clarify things a bit?\n\n**User:**\nThat's fascinating! Could you give me an example of how this symbolism was used in a specific myth or story?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! One example is the story of Orpheus, who ventured into the underworld to retrieve his beloved Eurydice. According to the myth, Orpheus descended into a cave that was believed to lead to the underworld. This cave, like others in Greek mythology, symbolized the transition from the world of the living to the world of the dead. Orpheus used his lyre to charm the souls and rulers of the underworld, showcasing how these natural formations were seen as pathways for both the spirits and living beings to navigate between the worlds. Does this help paint a clearer picture?\n\n**User:**\nThat story really brings it to life! Are there any other myths or stories that use ravines and caves in this way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are several other myths and stories that use ravines and caves to symbolize the underworld. For instance, in the eleventh book of Homer's \"Odyssey,\" Odysseus encounters the Sirens, who are said to lure sailors to their deaths by singing from a rock that is believed to be an entrance to the underworld. Additionally, in the story of Persephone, she is abducted by Hades and taken to the underworld through a cave, which is a direct representation of the passage from the upper world to the lower world. These examples illustrate how ravines and caves served as powerful symbols in Greek mythology, reflecting the belief in a world beyond the visible one."}
