The third picture represents Mithra, when he grasps the head ornament of the sun, the nimbus. This act recalls to us, first of all, the violence of Horus towards Isis; secondly, the Christian basic thought, _that those who have overcome attain the crown of eternal life_. On the fourth picture Sol kneels before Mithra. These last two representations show plainly that Mithra has taken to himself the strength of the sun, so that he becomes the lord of the sun as well. He has conquered “his animal nature,” the bull. The animal knows no incest prohibition; man is, therefore, man because he conquers the incest wish, that is, the animal nature. Thus Mithra has sacrificed his animal nature, the incest wish, and with that has overcome the mother, that is to say, “the terrible death-bringing mother.” A solution is already anticipated in the Gilgamesh epic through the formal renunciation of the horrible Ishtar by the hero. The overcoming of the mother in the Mithraic sacrifice, which had almost an ascetic character, took place no longer by the archaic overpowering, but through the renunciation, the sacrifice of the wish. The primitive thought of incestuous reproduction through entrance into the mother’s womb had already been displaced, because man was so far advanced in domestication that he believed that the eternal life of the sun is reached, not through the perpetration of incest, but through the sacrifice of the incest wish. This important change expressed in the Mithraic mystery finds its full expression for the first time in the symbol of the crucified God.

How does this act relate to other cultural myths or beliefs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's an interesting detail! The act of Mithra grasping the head ornament of the sun, the nimbus, can indeed be seen in the context of other cultural myths and beliefs. It's reminiscent of the violence in the myth of Horus, who was known to fight fiercely for his rightful place. In the case of Mithra, this act symbolizes overcoming and triumph. \n\nIt's also worth noting the thematic similarity to the Christiratian narve where those who have overcome and achieved spiritual victory are often depicted as receiving a crown or a crown of eternal life. The idea of grasping or achieving a crown or ornament signifies a kind of reward or recognition for having successfully navigated challenges. \n\nDoes this help you understand the connection better, or do you have other questions about Mithra or related myths?"}
