{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": "These symbols are easily read: Sun—Phallus, Moon—Vagina (Uterus). This interpretation is confirmed by another figure of the same collection. There the same representation is found, only the vessel[414] is replaced by the figure of a woman. The impressions on coins, where in the middle a palm is seen encoiled by a snake, flanked by two stones (testicles), or else in the middle a stone encircled by a snake; to the right a palm, to the left a shell (female genitals[415]), should be interpreted in a similar manner. In Lajard’s “Researches” (“The Cult of Venus”) there is a coin of Perga, where Artemis of Perga is represented by a conical stone (phallic) flanked by a man (claimed to be Men) and by a female figure (claimed to be Artemis). Men (the so-called Lunus) is found upon an Attic bas-relief apparently with the spear but fundamentally a sceptre with a phallic significance, flanked by Pan with a club (phallus) and a female figure.[416] The traditional representation of the Crucified flanked by John and Mary is closely associated with this circle of ideas, precisely as is the Crucified with the thieves. From this we see how, beside the Sun, there emerges again and again the much more primitive comparison of the libido with the phallus. An especial trace still deserves mention here. The Dadophor Cautapates, who represents Mithra, is also represented with the cock[417] and the pineapple. But these are the attributes of the Phrygian god Men, whose cult was widely diffused. Men was represented with Pileus,[418] the pineapple and the cock, also in the form of a boy, just as the Dadophores are boyish figures. (This last-named property relates them with Men to the Cabiri.) Men has a very close connection with Attis, the son and lover of Cybele. In the time of the Roman Cæsars, Men and Attis were entirely identified, as stated above. Attis also wears the Pileus like Men, Mithra and the Dadophores.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "Men（也被称作Lunus）在古希腊陶器上的象征意义是什么？其中Men手持一根带有的阳具象征意义的权杖，两侧分别是手持蛇杖的潘神（Pan）和一个女性形象。", "answer": "在古希腊陶器上，Men手持一根带有阳具象征意义的权杖（本质上是一根权杖），两侧分别是手持蛇杖的潘神（Pan，象征阳具）和一个女性形象。这里的Men象征着与性相关的符号，而潘神则象征着阳具。", "question_group_id": "82d08b22-4898-49bf-bd79-232dea05e508", "paragraph_idx": 462, "question_idx": 3}], "question_answer_pairs_string": "**QUESTION:**\nMen（也被称作Lunus）在古希腊陶器上的象征意义是什么？其中Men手持一根带有的阳具象征意义的权杖，两侧分别是手持蛇杖的潘神（Pan）和一个女性形象。\n\n**ANSWER:**\n在古希腊陶器上，Men手持一根带有阳具象征意义的权杖（本质上是一根权杖），两侧分别是手持蛇杖的潘神（Pan，象征阳具）和一个女性形象。这里的Men象征着与性相关的符号，而潘神则象征着阳具。\n", "conversation": "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\n在古希腊陶器上的Men（也被称作Lunus）象征意义是什么？其中Men手持一根带有的阳具象征意义的权杖，两侧分别是手持蛇杖的潘神（Pan）和一个女性形象。\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n在古希腊陶器上，Men（也被称为Lunus）手持一根带有阳具象征意义的权。两杖侧分别是手持蛇杖的潘神（Pan，象征阳具）和一个女性形象。Men在这里象征着与性相关的符号，而潘神则象征着阳具。这种描绘反映了古希腊文化中性器官和生育能力的象征意义，同时也展示了多重神祇之间的关联。这样的图案通常与性、生育以及可能的农业丰收等概念相关联。您还有其他问题需要了解吗？\n\n**User:**\n非常感谢您的解释。我想进一步了解一下潘神拿着蛇杖的意义。\n\n**AI Assistant:**\n当然，很高兴您感兴趣！潘神（Pan）手持蛇杖，这一形象在古希腊艺术中非常常见。蛇杖在古希腊文化中通常代表生育力和康复。潘神作为山林之神，与自然和性相关联，他的蛇杖象征着自然力量和生育能力。在许多神话故事中，潘神的形象与自然界的生机勃勃和繁衍旺盛紧密相连。蛇杖作为一种象征，强调了潘神力量的多重维度，既包括生殖力，也包括治疗和治愈。\n\n您还有其他问题需要我为您解答吗？"}
