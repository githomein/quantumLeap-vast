Can you explain what it suggests about the use of current language during this process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure! According to the text, during the process of discovery, individuals use current language and meanings that are already embodied in social and conventional usage. They erect their thoughts \"schematically\" or \"problematically,\" projecting an opinion as if it were true, but these thoughts remain personal and conditional. It's interesting to see how our understanding evolves from the language we already know.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does the text describe the relationship between language and thought?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe text describes the relationship between language and thought as intertwined. Language grows and develops alongside thought, embodying both personal and social aspects. It maintains a dual reference, reflecting traditional and individual gains. Essentially, language serves as a record of tradition and the judgments of the race, training new generations in the process of making judgments.\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite insightful. Can you tell me what the passage implies about the role of language in societal progress?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely. The text implies that language plays a crucial role in societal progress by embodying the gains made by individual geniuses and reflecting the racial conquests and traditional judgments. It serves as a social copy-system that not only records these judgments but also  a tacts asraining ground for future generations to develop their own judgments. This highlights how language is not just a tool for communication but a dynamic system that shapes and is shaped by societal advancements."}
