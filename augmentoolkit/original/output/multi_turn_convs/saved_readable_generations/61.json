{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": "When I said just now that directed thinking is properly a thinking with words, and quoted that clever testimony of Anatole France as drastic proof of it, a misunderstanding might easily arise, namely, that directed thinking is really only “word.” That certainly would go too far. Language should, however, be comprehended in a wider sense than that of speech, which is in itself only the expression of the formulated thought which is capable of being communicated in the widest sense. Otherwise, the deaf mute would be limited to the utmost in his capacity for thinking, which is not the case in reality. Without any knowledge of the spoken word, he has his “language.” This language, considered from the standpoint of history, or in other words, directed thinking, is here a descendant of the primitive words, as, for instance, Wundt[22] expresses it.“A further important result of that co-operation of sound and sign  interchange consists in the fact that very many words gradually lose  altogether their original concrete thought meaning, and turn into  signs for general ideas and for the expression of the apperceptive  functions of relation and comparison and their products. In this  manner abstract thought develops, which, because it would not be  possible without the change of meaning lying at the root of it, is  indeed a production of that psychic and psychophysical reciprocal  action out of which the development of language takes place.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the significance of the example of the deaf mute in the context of language and thinking?", "answer": "The example of the deaf mute is significant because it demonstrates that thinking is not restricted to spoken language.

Deaf mutes, even without knowledge of spoken words, can develop a form of language through other means, such as sign language. This shows that the capacity for thinking is broader and more flexible than just the use of spoken words.\n", "conversation": "**User:**\nI've been reading about the example of the deaf mute in relation to language and thinking. Can you explain the significance of this example?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The example of the deaf mute is quite significant in the context of language and thinking because it highlights that the act of thinking is not inherently tied to spoken language. Even without the ability to speak or understand spoken words, a deaf mute can develop and use their own form of language, such as sign language. This demonstrates that the capacity for thought and communication is broader and more flexible than just the use of spoken words. Does that help clarify the significance of the example? Do you have any other questions about it?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, does this mean that the ability to think and communicate is more about the mechanism of conveying ideas, rather than the specific form of language?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExactly! You've got it. The ability to think is indeed more about the underlying mechanism of conveying and processing ideas, rather than the specific form of language. Whether it's through spoken words, sign language, writing, or any other form of communication, the core of thinking and conveying thoughts remains the same. The example of the deaf mute illustrates this beautifully. Do you have any other questions on this topic?\n\n**User:**\nAre there any other examples that demonstrate this idea of thinking not being restricted to spoken language?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, there are several other examples that can illustrate this idea. For instance, consider the use of written language, which predates spoken language in human history. Many ancient cultures developed writing systems that enabled them to record and communicate complex thoughts and ideas without the need for speech. Additionally, there are cases of individuals who, due to brain injuries or other conditions, can understand language but have difficulty in speaking or writing. These cases further demonstrate that thought processes can occur independently of the ability to use spoken or written language.\n\nAnother example comes from the field of artificial intelligence, where machines can process and generate ideas without the use of human language. AI systems can understand and respond to queries through a process that doesn't involve spoken or written language in the traditional sense, but rather through algorithms and data processing.\n\nDo these examples help reinforce the idea that thinking is not restricted to spoken language?"}
