After the prayer, the dreamer saw the head of a sphinx with an Egyptian headdress, which quickly vanished. This vision seemed to disturb the dreamer, causing her to wake up briefly. Can you tell me more about what the dreamer saw and her reaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! After the prayer, the dreamer saw the head of a sphinx with an gyptiaEn headdress, which vanished quickly. This vision caused the dreamer to become disturbed, leading her to briefly wake up. The disappearance of the sphinx and the dreamer's reaction suggest a moment of intense emotion or confusion.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. How does the vision of the sphinx relate to the concept of a riddle or puzzle in this text/passage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe vision of the sphinx is significant because in the whole civilized world, the sphinx is associated with riddles and puzzles. Just like the sphinx of Oedipus who stood at the portal of his fate, proposing a riddle, the sphinx in the dream symbolizes a puzzling creature that presents riddles. This association adds depth to the dreamer's experience, suggesting that the sphinx might represent a challenge or a mystery that needs to be understood.\n\n**User:**\nCan you explain what the sphinx represents in terms of mythological and psychological interpretations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The sphinx can be interpreted as a semi-theriomorphic representation of the \"mother image,\" often referred to as the \"terrible mother.\" This image is significant in mythology and has been found in many cultures. The sphinx, in its traditional form, is a half-human, half-animal creature that symbolizes this powerful and often fearsome maternal figure.\n\nIn psychological terms, the sphinx might represent unresolved conflicts or issues that the dreamer is grappling with. The fearsome aspects of the mother can symbolize a sense of danger or a need to confront deep-seated emotions or memories.\n\n**User:**\nWhy is there a discussion about whether to interpret the sphinx as the Sphinx of Oedipus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere is a discussion about whether to interpret the sphinx as the Sphinx of Oedipus because the author suggests that the only justification for this connection is the use of the word \"Sphinx.\" Without subjective materials or personal experiences from the dreamer, an individual interpretation would be difficult. The author acknowledges that the suggestion of an \"Egyptian\" phantasy is insufficient for this specific vision. Therefore, the author recommends referring to available ethnographic materials to understand this vision, possibly in a manner that might seem too daring or speculative."}
