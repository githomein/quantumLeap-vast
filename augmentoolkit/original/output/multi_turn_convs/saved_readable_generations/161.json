The text suggests that the ancients did not succeed in putting themselves in possession of the force of nature. Can you elaborate on what the text says about the lack of cultural development among the ancients?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! According to the text, the ancients didn't succeed in mastering the force of nature primarily due to their lack of training in directed thinking. This means they couldn't sublimate libido from other natural relations or adopt anthropomorphism voluntarily. In contrast, modern times are marked by the mobility of libido and its capacity for transference, which are seen as modern acquisitions. Does this help clarify the differences in cultural development between ancient and modern times? Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Could you explain what you mean by the \"mobility of the libido\" and why it's important for cultural development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! The \"mobility of the libido\" refers to the ability of libido to shift from one natural relation to another. This capacity is crucial for cultural development because it allows for the sublimation of libido. Sublimation is the process of redirecting energy from instinctual or primitive desires to more sophisticated and directed thinking. This, in turn, supports the advancement and refinement of culture. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nI see. How does the text describe the difference between ancient and modern cultural development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe text contrasts ancient and modern cultural development by highlighting the lack of training in directed thinking among the ancients. The ancients couldn't sublimate libido from other natural relations voluntarily and didn't engage in anthropomorphism. In contrast, modern cultural development is attributed to the mobility of libido and its capacity for transference. This allows for more advanced and directed thinking, which drives cultural progress. Does this help explain the difference? Is there anything else you'd like to know about cultural development?"}
