He cut it apart like a flat fish, into two parts,[530]     One half he took and with it he covered the Heavens.”In this manner Marduk created the universe from the mother. It is clearly evident that the killing of the mother-dragon here takes place under the idea of a wind fecundation with negative accompaniments.The world is created from the mother, that is to say, from the libido taken away from the mother through sacrifice. We shall have to consider this significant formula more closely in the last chapter. The most interesting parallels to this primitive myth are to be found in the literature of the Old Testament, as Gunkel[531] has brilliantly pointed out. It is worth while to trace the psychology of these parallels._Isaiah_ li:9:(9) “Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in the  ancient days, in the generation of old. Art thou not it that hath cut  Rahab, and wounded the dragon?(10) “Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the  great deep, that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the  ransomed to pass over?”The name of Rahab is frequently used for Egypt in the Old Testament, also dragon. _Isaiah_, chapter xxx, verse 7, calls Egypt “the silent Rahab,” and means, therefore, something evil and hostile. Rahab is the well-known whore of Jericho, who later, as the wife of Prince Salma, became the ancestress of Christ. Here Rahab appeared as the old dragon, as Tiâmat, against whose evil power Marduk, or Jehovah, marched forth. The expression “the ransomed” refers to the Jews freed from bondage, but it is also mythological, for the hero again frees those previously devoured by the whale.

It also has a mythological dimension, where a hero, like Marduk or Jehovah, frees those who were previously devoured, symbolizing the liberation of people from oppressive forces.\n", "conversation": "**User:**\nI'm reading h 51:9-Isaia10 and came across the term \"ransomed.\" Could you explain what it means in that context?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! In Isaiah 51:9-10, the term \"ransomed\" refers to the idea of liberation and freedom from bondage or oppression. Specifically, it talks about how God has freed his people from their past captivity, much like a hero might rescue their people from being devoured or conquered. This metaphor highlights how God has delivered the Jewish people from their oppressive circumstances, much like a mythological hero might free a society from a terrible fate. Does that help clarify the term for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense, but could you give me a bit more detail on how it fits into the overall message of those verses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! In Isaiah 51:9-10, the phrase \"ravished from the womb\" and \"given up for adoption\" (which can be understood as a form of ransoming) is used to convey the idea that God has taken care of his people from the very beginning, from their earliest moments. The term \"ransomed\" here emphasizes that God, like a rescuer or liberator, has freed them from their past suffering and oppression.\n\nThe broader context of these verses is about God’s promises and his role as a protector and liberator of his people. It speaks of a time when God will reveal his strength and power to his people, and how he has already acted to free them from their past enslavement. This is a powerful metaphor that not only looks back on past deliverances but also looks forward to future deliverance and salvation.\n\nDoes this help provide more context for the term \"ransomed\" in these verses? Do you have any other questions about the passage?"}
