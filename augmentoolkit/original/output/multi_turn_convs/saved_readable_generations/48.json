How does the speaker describe this absence?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe speaker describes the absence of the countenance and melody as a distant and lost experience, noting that the melody, or the countenance's music, is no longer heard. They express a deep longing for the times when the countenance's music brought peace and joy, suggesting a sense of loss and separation from those happy moments.\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite evocative. The passage also mentions something about work and effort in relation to child or primitive man. Can you tell me what it suggests about this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The text suggests that work and effort, particularly when they involve long-term commitment and distant goals, are not natural to a child or primitive man. These individuals are more inclined towards immediate pleasure and have a tendency to avoid laborious tasks for future rewards. This implies that insng atilli sense of work and effort in such individuals can be challenging due to their inherent high inertia and irresponsibility.\n\nDo you have any other questions about the passage or any other topics?"}
