According to the author, what does the condition of patients suggest about their perception of reality?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe author suggests that patients often substitute phantasies for reality. These phantasies are similar to incorrect mental products from the past but were once their perception of reality. These phantasies act as a substitute for the disturbed function of reality, serving as archaic surrogates. This means that patients rely on these phantasies to navigate their current reality, which is often distorted or disrupted.\n\n**User:**\nThat's intriguing. Could you give me an example of how the author illustrates the concept of substituting phantasies for reality?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure, the author uses the example of Zosimos' vision to illustrate how old superstitions acted as symbols, permitting transitions to remote territories. In this context, these symbols served as convenient bridges, allowing a partial amount of libido to be directed into the mental realm during certain archaic periods. This is a way of understanding how patients might substitute phantasies for their current reality, using old symbols or beliefs as a means to cope or navigate their psychological challenges.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Now, I'm curious about what Dr. Spielrein believes about the origin of symbols. Could you clarify that for me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Dr. Spielrein believes that symbols generally originate from the tendency of a complex for dissolution in the common totality of thought. This means that as complexes lose their individual personal elements, they transform into symbols. This tendency towards the dissolution (or transformation) of every individual complex is seen as the motive behin forms of cd variousreative expression, such as poetry, painting, and other arts. In the context of patients, these symbols can serve as a means of coping with psychological disturbances, often manifesting as creative or symbolic behaviors.\n\n**User:**\nThank you for explaining that. Finally, I wanted to know how the concept of archaic surrogates is related to the patients' condition in the context of psychoanalytic theory.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe concept of archaic surrogates is closely related to the patients' condition in that they substitute phantasies for reality. These phantasies are similar to incorrect mental products from the past but once served as their perception of reality. Archaic surrogates act as a replacement for the disturbed function of reality, providing a way for patients to cope with their condition. Essentially, these surrogates allow patients to maintain a sense of reality in a way that is more manageable for them, even if it means deviating from the truth or their current reality."}
