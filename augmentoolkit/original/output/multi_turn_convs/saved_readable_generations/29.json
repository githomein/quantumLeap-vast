Can you explain what the problem of psychoanalysis is as expressed mythologically in the passage?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The problem of psychoanalysis, as expressed mythologically, is the sacrifice and rebirth of the infantile hero. This represents the psychological journey of transforming and transcending one's childlike self through sacrifice and renewal. It's a metaphorical process where the individual must let go of their innocence and innocence-bound desires to grow and evolve.\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite insightful. I've also been reading \"The Awakening\" by Kate Chopin and noticed a significant moment where the daughter's libido is devoured by the mother. Can you tell me about the significance of this in the novel?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! In \"The Awakening,\" the end where the daughter's libido is devoured by the mother symbolizes a critical psychological moment. It represents the loss or subsumption of the daughter's energy or emotional connection by the mother, indicating a potential imbalance in their relationship. This scene can be seen as a manifestation of the oppressive dynamics between the characters and the societal expectations that constrain them.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm also curious about why it's necessary to free libido for complete devotion to life. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Freeing the libido is necessary for complete devotion to life because it allows an individual to break free from unconscious compulsions and desires that can inhibit genuine engagement with the world. By releasing the libido, one can more fully embrace and commit to life's experiences, rather than being driven by hidden or unresolved emotional ties. This process is crucial for personal growth and the formation of a more authentic connection to reality."}
