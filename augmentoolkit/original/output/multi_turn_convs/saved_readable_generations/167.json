Directed and adapted thinking is considered more rational and corrected by societal norms, whereas subjective thinking, if not corrected, leads to a distorted view of the world.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat term does the author use to describe thinking that is not corrected by adapted thinking, and how is it characterized?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe author refers to thinking that is not corrected by adapted thinking as \"infantile.\" This form of thinking is characterized by a subjective, ego-driven nature, which can lead to an overwhelmingly distorted perception of the world.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nAccording to the text, where does this \"infantile\" thinking exist?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThis \"infantile\" thinking exists in both the individual past and the past of mankind. It refers to the form of thinking that is not corrected by adapted thinking, leading to a subjective and distorted view of the world.\n", "conversation": "**User:**\nI've been reading a book by an author named [Name of the Author], and I'm curious about how they differentiate between two kinds of thinking. Could you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The author [Name of the Author] makes a distinction between two primary types of thinking: directed and adapted thinking, on one hand, and subjective, ego-driven thinking on the other. Directed and adapted thinking is often viewed as more rational and is influenced by societal norms, ensuring alignment with broader societal values and expectations. On the other hand, subjective thinking, if left uncorrected, tends to lead to a skewed or distorted view of the world.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. In the text, the author uses a specific term for the kind of thinking that isn't corrected by adapted thinking. Could you tell me what that term is and how it's characterized?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the author refers to thinking that is not corrected by adapted thinking as \"infantile.\" This form of thinking is characterized by its subjective and ego-driven nature, which often results in a profoundly distorted perception of reality. It's as if the individual is still operating in a more primitive, less corrected mental state, influenced heavily by personal biases and ego.\n\n**User:**\nSo, where does this \"infantile\" thinking come from, according to the text?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the text, this \"infantile\" thinking exists both in the individual's past and in the past of mankind as a whole. The author suggests that this type of thinking persists in the individual's psyche and can also be observed in the broader historical context, indicating a deep-seated, uncorrected form of cognitive processing that resists rational adaptation and societal correction."}
