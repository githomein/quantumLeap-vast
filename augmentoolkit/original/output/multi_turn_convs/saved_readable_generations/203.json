Could you tell me how the author describes the effect of retrosctive lpeonging on a person's energy and enterprise?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The author describes retrospective longing as a paralyzing poison that acts on a person's energy and enterprise, comparing it to a poisonous serpent lying across one's path. It appears to be a hostile force that robs a person of energy, but in reality, it is the individual's unconscious tendency to regress that is overcoming their conscious efforts to move forward. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this concept?\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite interesting. Can you also explain what some of the causes are that lead to the development of a retrogressive tendency in a person?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOf course! The causes of a retrogressive tendency in a person can include natural aging, which weakens energy; great external difficulties that cause a person to break down and revert to a childlike state; and a woman who enslaves a man, preventing him from freeing himself and causing him to become a child again. These factors can all contribute to a person's regression. Do you have any other questions on this topic?\n\n**User:**\nCould you explain how Isis might symbolize the concept of the unconscious enslaving the conscious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly. In the mythological context, Isis, as the sister-wife of the sun-god, creates a poisonous animal from the spittle of the god, which could symbolize the libido or the god's power. By receiving this power, Isis makes the god weak and dependent, thereby assuming the dominating role of the mother. This can be seen as a metaphor for the unconscious (symbolized by Isis) enslaving the conscious (symbolized by the sun-god) and causing a regression. Does that help clarify the symbolism?\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite insightful. Could you also explain how the mythical figure Delilah is related to the weakening of adult men and the return to a childlike state?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Delilah, in the myth of Samson, cuts off Samson’s hair, which symbolizes the sun’s rays and his strength. By removing his hair, Delilah robs Samson of his strength, causing him to weaken and return to a childlike state. This illustrates how any weakening of an adult man can strengthen the unconscious desires that lead to a regression towards a dependent and childlike condition. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this myth?\n\n**User:**\nAccording to Freud, how does the weakening of adult men connect to the desires of the unconscious?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Freud, any weakening of an adult man, whether due to natural aging, external difficulties, or a woman enslaving him, allows the unconscious desires to strengthen. This weakening directly manifests as a backward striving towards a dependent and childlike state, symbolizing a regression towards the mother figure. Does this help explain the connection between the weakening of adult men and the desires of the unconscious?"}
