Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The text suggests that unresolved sexual issues, particularly those rooted in incestuous bonds, can prevent an individual from achieving true freedom. According to the text, if these problems are not addressed, the individual's libido remains fixated in those unresolved issues. This fixation hinders the person from becoming the center of their own system and breaking free from familial bonds. Essentially, addressing these issues is crucial for achieving genuine freedom and well-being.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What does the text imply about the consequences of allowing the incestuous libido to play freely without any higher purpose?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe text implies that if a person allows their incestuous libido to run freely without serving any higher purpose, they become subject to unconscious compulsion. This means that rather than making choices based on rational thought and self-determination, the individual is dominated by the libido εἱμαρμένη. As a result, their destiny and life experiences are not truly in their own hands. Instead, their adventures and decisions are dictated by this unconscious compulsion, and they will experience the outcomes of their actions as if they were preordained by some external force."}
