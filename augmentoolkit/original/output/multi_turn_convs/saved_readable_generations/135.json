Can you clarify what it was like when she began describing a painful event during the analytic treatment?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! During the beginning of the analytic treatment, the patient fell into a hysterical-dreamy state when describing a very painful occurrence. In this state, she exhibited all signs of sexual excitement and even performed a masturbative act (frictio femorum). This initial state is quite telling and sets the stage for further analysis.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I noticed she made a peculiar gesture during this state. Can you tell me what it was, and what Freud inferred about its significance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, during her hysterical-dreamy state, the patient made a very violent rotary motion with the forefinger of her left hand on her left temple, as if she was boring a hole there. Freud inferred that this gesture was significant and related to infantile ludus sexualis, indicating preliminary exercises leading to sexual activity. This gesture is seen as a clear indication of early sexual tendencies.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I also read about her behavior of boring a hole in the wall and beating her head against the cupboard door. What does the author of this text infer about these actions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe author infers that the patient's behavior of boring a hole in the wall and beating her head against the cupboard door can also be related to infantile ludus sexualis. These actions are seen as preliminary exercises or gestures that are preparatory to sexual activity. The author considers these behaviors important as they demonstrate early signs of sexual development, even if the exact significance is not fully understood."}
