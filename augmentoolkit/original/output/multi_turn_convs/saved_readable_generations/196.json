The author seems to make some interesting points about how human psychology relates to the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Hartmann. Can you explain what the author highlights about human psychology in this context?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The author highlights a significant observation that, despite the wide differences in the contents of individual consciousness, people are closely alike in their unconscious psychology. This observation provides deep psychological justification for essential portions of Schopenhauer and Hartmann's philosophies. The uniformity of the unconscious mechanism serves as a foundational basis for these philosophic views, indicating that the unconscious contains remnants of earlier psychological functions that were overridden by individual differentiation.\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite intriguing. How does the author describe the difference between the human psyche and the animal psyche in terms of uniformity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe author describes the reaction and products of the animal psyche as showing a generally diffused and uniform solidity. In contrast, humans appear as something extraordinarily individual compared to animals. This distinction highlights how, while animals' psychological responses might share certain uniform traits, human psychology is much more varied and unique.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these philosophical ideas or the text you're reading?"}
