Can you explain what he said about this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Freud suggests that the mythological reference to the \"treasure difficult of attainment\" in the context of fire theft is akin to the act of plucking or tearing something off a taboo tree, which is considered a forbidden and dangerous act. This idea is exemplified in customs like the old barbaric custom in the service of Diana of Aricia, where only those who dare to tear off a bough from her sacred grove can become priests. This act is later symbolized in vulgar speech as an act of onanism. Does that help clarify Freud's view on this mythological element?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Do you have more information on Freud's hypothesis about the deepest stratum of onanism in relation to incest and autoeroticism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure, Freud hypothesizes that in the deepest stratum, which is the incestuous stage that precedes the autoerotic stage, the meanings of \"reiben\" (to rub) and \"reissen\" (to break off) might coincide. This hypothesis is based on the idea that through the myth of the fire theft, the two meanings are united, and this connection can be traced through etymology even when there is a lack of mythological tradition. This suggests a deep, symbolic connection between these acts and their broader cultural and psychological significance. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this topic?"}
