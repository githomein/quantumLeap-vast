The author [Name of Author] illustrates the transition of tree symbolism from a mother figure to a phallic symbol through a gradual and subtle process. This transition is particularly evident in medieval family trees, where the first ancestor is often represented by the trunk of a tree. In this context, the trunk symbolizes the \"membrum virile,\" which is a phallic symbol. Additionally, the author points out that the tree's symbolism can be bisexual, as it is commonly referred to with masculine terminology in Latin, despite being assigned a feminine gender in Latin grammar.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Could you give an example of a dream and its symbolic elements?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure! In an example of a woman's dream, the symbolic elements include a garden with a remarkable exotic tree bearing strange red fleshy flowers or fruits. The dreamer picks and eats these fruits, only to feel poisoned as a result. Using the framework of antique or poetic symbolism, the red fleshy flowers or fruits can be interpreted as phallic symbols. The act of eating them and feeling poisoned might symbolize the retention of libido or, more broadly, the potential for emotional or psychological distress stemming from desires or actions that feel unfulfilling or problematic.\n\nDoes this help clarify the symbolic elements and their interpretations in the dream example?"}
