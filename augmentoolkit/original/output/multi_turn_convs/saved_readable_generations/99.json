Why is the Sphinx sent to Thebes by Hera, and what does it symbolize?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a fascinating question! According to Greek mythology, the Sphinx is sent to Thebes by Hera because she hates the city due to the birth of Bacchus. The Sphinx symbolizes the fear of the mother, which is a key element in the Oedipus legend. When Oedipus solves the Sphinx's riddle, he conquers this fear and is eventually led to marry Jocasta, his mother, as the throne and the hand of the widowed queen of Thebes belong to him who frees the land from the Sphinx's plague.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting! Could you tell me more about the genealogy of the Sphinx and how it relates to the concept of the mother in mythology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The Sphinx has a complex genealogy that reflects the concept of the mother in mythology. The Sphinx is a daughter of Echnida, a mixed being who is described as a beautiful maiden above and a hideous serpent below. This double creature symbolizes the mother, with the human, lovely and attractive half above and the horrible animal half below, which is transformed into a fear animal due to the incest prohibition.

This symbol can be used to understand the original incestuous amounts of libido that are often detached from the mother, reflecting deep psychological and emotional conflicts. Does this help clarify the role of the Sphinx in both mythology and psychology?"}
