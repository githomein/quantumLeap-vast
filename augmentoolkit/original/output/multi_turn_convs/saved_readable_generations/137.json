The author seems to suggest something deeper than just physical desires. Can you explain what the author is getting at?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The author suggests that the erotic root, despite its intense and mysterious nature, is not fully understood. There's an implication that this root is connected to a purpose of great biological significance, possibly hinting at deeper, evolutionary goals that go beyond mere physical desires.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. The author also mentions the libidian current. Can you explain how the author connects this to historical and religious ideals?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely. The author links the libidian current to historical and religious ideals by pointing out that it aligns with the ecstatic ideal of the Middle Ages and ancient mystery cults, which later transformed into Christian ideals. This ideal is viewed as a form of psychologic projection, or a paranoidian mechanism, as Freud might describe it. Essentially, the author suggests that conflicts and repressions are often repressed into the unconscious and then projected into seemingly objective forms, like religious or historical ideals."}
