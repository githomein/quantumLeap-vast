Self-concentration and the strength derived from it correspond to a primitive train of thought and explain numerous sacrificial and magic rites that have been previously discussed. These rites often reflect an attempt to channel and harness spiritual or divine power through intense focus and mental fortitude.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. Can you elaborate on the significance of the wooden horse in Homer's *Iliad*?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! The wooden horse in Homer's *Iliad* is a symbolic representation of a hero who is reborn from the mother, much like the sun. This is evident in the role of the horse as a means to enter the city of Troy undetected. It allows the besieging Greek forces to infiltrate the citadel, leading to the fall of Troy despite its impregnable nature. The wooden horse thus represents a clever stratagem that overcomes the city's defenses, symbolizing the rebirth and renewal that the hero undergoes.\n\n**User:**\nI see. Can you explain how the story of Philoctetes illustrates the concept of the repressed incest wish of the son?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAbsolutely! In the story of Philoctetes, he represents a projection of the repressed incest wish of the son. Philoctetes, being the only one in the Trojan expedition who knew the hidden sanctuary of Chryse, where the Argonauts had sacrificed and where the Greeks planned to sacrifice, symbolizes the son's hidden desires or fea.rs The nymph Chryse, who loved Philoctetes and cursed him for spurning her love, serves as a symbol of the mother figure and the repressed incest wish. This projection suggests that the son sees the mother as having the evil wish, which leads to his fear and belief that she threatens or pursues him.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does the story of Philoctetes relate to the concept of the fear of persecution?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to the different versions of the story, Philoctetes' foot injury or bite by a serpent symbolizes the realization of the curse of Chryse. In one version, Philoctetes injures his foot with one of his own poisonous arrows when approaching his altar. In another, more extensively proven version, he is bitten in his foot by a poisonous serpent. This foot injury, stemming from the curse, causes Philoctetes to become ailing and keeps him separated from the rest of the group. This separation reflects the son's fear of persecution and the mother's perceived threat, symbolically keeping them apart to avoid the fear of returning to her.\n\nDo you have any more questions or need further clarification on these topics?"}
