{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": "_Hort_ is a mediæval and Old High German word with the meaning of “collected and guarded treasure”; Gothic, _huzd_; Old Scandinavian, _hodd_; Germanic _hozda_, from pre-Germanic _kuzdhó_—for _kudtho_—“the concealed.” Kluge[706] adds to this the Greek κεύθω, έκυθον = “to hide, to conceal.” Also _hut_ (_hut_, to guard; English, hide), Germanic root _hud_, from Indo-Germanic _kuth_ (questionable), to Greek κεύθω and κύσθος, “cavity,” feminine genitals. Prellwitz,[707] too, traces Gothic _huzd_, Anglo-Saxon _hyde_, English hide and hoard, to Greek κεύθω. Whitley Stokes traces English hide, Anglo-Saxon _hydan_, New High German _Hütte_, Latin _cûdo_ = helmet; Sanskrit _kuhara_ (cave?) to primitive Celtic _koudo_ = concealment; Latin, _occultatio_.The assumption of Kluge is also supported in other directions; namely, from the point of view of the primitive idea:“There exists in Athens[708] a sacred place (a Temenos) of Ge, with  the surname Olympia. Here the ground is torn open for about a yard in  width; and they say, after the flood at the time of Deucalion, that  the water receded here; and every year they throw into the fissure  wheatmeal, kneaded with honey.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does Kluge's assumption support in relation to the term \"Hort\"?", "answer": "Kluge's assumption supports the connection between the term \"Hort\" and the Greek words κεύθω and κύσθος, both of which relate to the concept of hiding and concealing.

Kluge's assumption supports the connection between the term \"Hort\" and the Greek words κεύθω and κύσθος. These words are both associated with the concept of hiding and concealing. Specifically, Kluge supports the idea that \"Hort\" is derived from the Greek word κεύθω, which means \"to hide\" or \"to conceal.\" This etymological link suggests that the term \"Hort\" might have origins in the notion of secrecy or concealment, which could be relevant in various contexts, such as literature or historical texts where \"Hort\" is used. Does this help clarify Kluge's assumptions for you? Do you have any specific examples or further questions in mind?"}
