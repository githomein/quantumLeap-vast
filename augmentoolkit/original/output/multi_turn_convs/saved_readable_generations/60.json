{"dict_list": [{"paragraph": "The fundamental pictures are the sacrificial death and the resurrection of Christ, like the self-sacrifice of the sun, which voluntarily breaks its sceptre, the fructifying rays, in the certain hope of resurrection. The following comments are to be noted in regard to “the sceptre of rays”: Spielrein’s patient says, “God pierces through the earth with his rays.” The earth, in the patient’s mind, has the meaning of woman. She also comprehends the sunbeam in mythologic fashion as something solid: “Jesus Christ has shown me his love, by striking against the window with a sunbeam.” Among other insane patients I have come across the same idea of the solid substance of the sunbeam. Here there is also a hint of the phallic nature of the instrument which is associated with the hero. Thor’s hammer, which, cleaving the earth, penetrates deeply into it, may be compared to the foot of Kaineus. The hammer is retained in the interior of the earth, like the treasure, and, in the course of time, it gradually comes again to the surface (“the treasure blooms”), meaning that it was born again from the earth. (Compare what has been said concerning the etymology of “swelling.”) On many monuments Mithra holds a peculiar object in his hands, which Cumont compares to a half-filled tube. Dieterich proves from his papyrus text that the object is the shoulder of the bull, the bear constellation. The shoulder has an indirect phallic meaning, for it is the part which is wanting in Pelops. Pelops was slaughtered by his father, Tantalus, dismembered, and boiled in a kettle, to make a meal for the gods. Demeter had unsuspectingly eaten the shoulder from this feast, when Zeus discovered the outrage. He had the pieces thrown back into the kettle, and, with the help of the life-dispensing Clotho, Pelops was regenerated, and the shoulder which was missing was replaced by an ivory one.

Demeter unknowingly ate the shoulder, prompting Zeus to regroup the pieces and regenerate Pelops, replacing the missing shoulder with an ivory one.

Can you explain the significance of that in the myth? How does it relate to the concept of regeneration?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! In the myth of Pelops, the missing shoulder is quite a significant detail. Pelops was dismembered by his father, Tantalus, and his body parts were served as a sacrificial meal. Demeter, being a key figure in the story, unknowingly ate Pelops' shoulder. In response to this, Zeus decided to resurrect Pelops by regrouping the remains and regenerating him. However, a clever substitution was made: the missing shoulder was replaced with one made of ivory. This act symbolizes the concept of regeneration and rebirth, as Pelops was brought back to life despite a crucial part of his body being missing. Does this help clarify the myth for you?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting! So, the use of an ivory shoulder was a clever way to show that Pelops was reborn. How does this relate to regeneration in a broader sense?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExactly! The use of an ivory shoulder is indeed a clever symbol. In a broader sense, the myth illustrates the idea of regeneration as something that can transcend physical limitations. It shows how life can be restored and reborn, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges. The substitution of the shoulder with ivory represents both the frailty and the resilience of life. It’s a powerful metaphor for how we can recover from loss and adversity. Does this give you a better understanding of the myth and its deeper meanings?\n\n**User:**\nThis myth is really intriguing. It seems to have a lot of symbolic value beyond just the story itself. How do you think this myth has influenced other stories or cultural practices?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe myth of Pelops, with its themes of sacrifice, regeneration, and the clever substitution of the ivory shoulder, has certainly left a lasting impact. It has influenced various other stories and cultural practices in different ways. For example, the idea of resurrection and rebirth is a common theme in many religions and mythologies, where deities or heroes rise from the dead. The clever substitution of the ivory shoulder can be seen as a precursor to similar magical or mystical elements found in later stories. Additionally, the myth has inspired artistic and literary works, where the theme of transformation and the overcoming of adversity continues to resonate. Does this give you a sense of how the myth has spread its influence?"}
