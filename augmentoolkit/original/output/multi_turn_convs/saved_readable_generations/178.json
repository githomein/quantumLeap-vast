Could you explain what it involves?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! According to the \"Book of Rites,\" the sacrifice to the spirit of Au involves burning wood in the flames. This spirit is a sacrifice to old departed women, who are the souls of departed cooks and are called \"old women.\" This practice seems to honor the memory of skilled cookesses and their contributions to the household.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I also read something about how the kitchen god evolves from pre-Buddhistic traditions. Could you elaborate on that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure! In the pre-Buddhistic tradition, the kitchen god is originally the spirit of the hearth and fire, which is the soul of departed cooks. Over time, this spirit transforms into a male ruler of the family, and he acts as a mediator between the family and the gods. Essentially, the old feminine fire spirit evolves into a form of Logos, a male figure who embodies the wisdom and presence of the ancient cooks.\n\n**User:**\nThat's fascinating. Moving on, I also came across the term \"Mithra\" and its connection to the sun and love. Could you tell me more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Mithra's name is connected with the neo-Persian word \"Mihr,\" which means \"sun and love.\" This term underscores the dual nature of Mithra as a god associated both with the sun and love. In many ancient cultures, the sun was often seen as a symbol of love and life, and Mithra's name reflects this dual aspect, linking him to both celestial and emotional realms."}
