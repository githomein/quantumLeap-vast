Could you explain it to me in the context of psychological development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Ontogenetic re-echo refers to the recurrence of certain psychological traits or processes in individuals as they develop, which are similar to those observed in earlier stages of human evolution or in different stages of a child's development. This concept helps us understand how certain behaviors or cognitive patterns might be remnants of our evolutionary past, reappearing in our own development.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting! How about phantastic thinking? When does that become more prominent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPhantastic thinking becomes more prominent when directed thinking ceases. This can occur due to a decrease in interest, slight fatigue, or a relaxation of attention. When directed thinking stops, the mind shifts to phantasies, often leading to a loss of consciousness of the present moment. Phantasies can be daydreams, imaginative constructs, or thoughts that deviate from the immediate reality.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, what exactly happens when attention slackens and directed thinking is no longer maintained?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen ntion slaatteckens and directed thinking is no longer maintained, the individual's consciousness of the present moment diminishes. This slackening of attention allows phantasies to take over, leading to a mental state where the individual's train of thought deviates from the immediate reality. Essentially, the mind starts to wander and may engage in fantasy or daydreaming, which can be a natural way to relax and process thoughts outside of the immediate context."}
