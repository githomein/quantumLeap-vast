What issue is suggested to have contributed to the \"energetic regression to the infantile\" in the early development of Christianity, alongside the revival of the incest problem?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a fascinating topic. One of the contributing issues to the \"energetic regression to the infantile\" in the early development of Christianity, alongside the revival of the incest problem, was the far-reaching depreciation of women. This depreciation had a significant impact on the psychological and social landscape of early Christian communities. Do you want to know more about how this depreciation affected Christianity?\n\n**User:**\nYes, that sounds interesting. How did the accessibility of sexuality at the time of Christianity's origin affect the perception of women?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe accessibility of sexuality during the time of Christianity's origin played a crucial role in shaping the perception of women. It led to a very excessive depreciation of women as sexual objects. This perspective not only influenced how women were treated but also how their roles and value within the early Christian community were understood. The focus on women primarily as sexual beings contributed to their marginalized position in many early Christian texts and teachings. Would you like to explore more about how this affected the early Christian community?\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite revealing. According to Freud's theory, how does the depreciation of the sexual object affect the outflow of libido that cannot be satisfied by sexuyal activit?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! According to Freud's theory, the depreciation of the sexual object hinders the outflow of libido that cannot be satisfied by sexual activity because that libido belongs to a desexualized higher order. This means that when women are seen as sexual objects, the remaining libido seeks higher, more difficult-to-obtain, and perhaps unattainable goals. For early Christians, these goals often symbolically aligned with the mother, representing a return to an idealized and desexualized form of femininity. This redirected libido results in a symbolic need that transforms the familiar, sinful world of the Olympian Gods into incomprehensible, dreamlike, and dark mysteries. Would you like to dive deeper into how this symbolic shift manifested in early Christian texts and practices?\n\n**User:**\nThat's quite complex. According to Freud, what symbolic needs arise due to the depreciation of the sexual object and the incest resistance?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to Freud, due to the depreciation of the sexual object and the incest resistance, symbolic needs arise again in an increased degree. These symbolic needs transform the familiar, sinful world of the Olympian Gods into incomprehensible, dreamlike, and dark mysteries, which include symbols and obscure meanings that distance us from the religious feelings of the Roman-Græco world. This transformation led to a spiritual and psychological shift, where early Christians sought to interpret the world through a lens of divine mystery and spiritual aspirations rather than through the traditional myths and gods of the ancient world. Would you like to explore more about this symbolic transformation and its impact on early Christian thought?"}
