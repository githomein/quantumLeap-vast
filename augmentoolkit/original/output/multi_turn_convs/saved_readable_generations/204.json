This is illustrated through Hiawatha, who is portrayed as a savior. The text highlights his marvellous birth, early great deeds, and his sacrifice for his fellow-men, preparing the audience to hear the attributes of a savior.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the text connect the description of Gitche Manito's footprints to other religious or mythological references?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe text connects the description of Gitche Manito's footprints to earlier utterances concerning the phallic and fertilizing nature of the horse’s foot and the horse’s steps, and especially to the legend of Hippocrene and the foot of Pegasus.

According to the text, the hero is a symbolic figure who unites libido, or a collective unconscious desire and energy, in the form of admiration and adoration. This unity leads to higher sublimations, often seen through the lens of myths. The character of Hiawatha exemplifies this role. He is described as having a marvellous birth, performing great deeds early in life, and ultimately sacrificing himself for his fellow men. This portrayal prepares the audience to understand the savior-like attributes he embodies. Does that help clarify the symbolic role of the hero and Hiawatha's role within it?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can you also explain how the text connects the description of Gitche Manito's footprints to other religious or mythological references?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure, the text draws interesting connections between the description of Gitche Manito's footprints and other religious and mythological themes. Firstly, it links the footprints to earlier mentions of the phallic and fertilizing qualities of the horse’s foot and its steps. Furthermore, the footprints are compared to the legend of Hippocrene, which was created by the foot of Pegasus, a mythological winged horse. These connections highlight the phallic and generative symbolism associated with the footprints. Additionally, the text draws parallels to Psalm 65, verses 9 to 11, which speak of God visiting the earth, watering it, and preparing its corn. This reference underscores the idea of the Creator's life-giving and nurturing power, much like Gitche Manito. Does this help in understanding the symbolic connections?"}
