According to Freud, what does the resistance against sexuality aim to prevent, and how does it redirect libido?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFreud suggested that resistance against sexuality aims to prevent the actual sexual act. However, it also seeks to redirect the libido away from the sexual function. Often, this redirection takes an earlier path, such as the incestuous one, which ultimately leads back to the parents. This redirection can be seen as an attempt to maintain familial bonds and avoid the perceived social and biological taboos. Does this help clarify things, or do you have more questions about this concept?\n\n**User:**\nThat helps a bit, but I'm still curious. According to Freud, how does the incest prohibition affect the initial stages of sexual transference?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe incest prohibition, as Freud described it, hinders the very first stages of sexual transference. This prohibition essentially blocks any early path that might lead to sexual activity, forcing the libido to regress to an earlier, presexual stage. In this stage, the libido was still partly in the function of nutrition, rather than sexual function. This regression, while hindered by the incest prohibition, takes place with great difficulty, leading to a quasi-desexualized state of phenomena.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. So, according to Freud, what specific part of the libido is pushed back to the presexual stage, and why is this pushback difficult to accomplish?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nFreud believed that the specific part of the libido pushed back to the presexual stage is the incestuous component. This is because the incestuous libido has been indistinguishably united with the sexual libido throughout the animal kingdom for ages. The process of separating these components is artificial and difficult, which is why the regression takes place with great difficulty. This separation and regression are part of the complex mechanisms Freud described in the development of the psyche.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. And what are the consequences of this regression to the presexual stage, and how do they affect the resulting phenomena?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe consequence of the regression of the incestuous component to the presexual stage is that it carries a considerable sexual character with it. Even though the resulting phenomena are stamped with the character of the sexual material, they are still influenced by the presexual nature. This means that the phenomena will exhibit a mix of both sexual and asexual characteristics. For example, a child might regress to behaviors that resemble those of a younger, more dependent stage while also showing signs of developing sexuality. This mix of aracchteristics is a key aspect of Freud's theories on psychological development and sexuality. Does this help you understand the concept better?"}
