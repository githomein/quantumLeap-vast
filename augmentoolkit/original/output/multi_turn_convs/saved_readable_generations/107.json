How are the figures of Horus and Harpocrates typically depicted in symbolic representations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! The figures of Horus and Harpocrates are usually depicted in symbolic representations as flanking the symbolic figure that corresponds to the father-son relationship. Horus is often shown as a well-formed, mature figure, whereas Harpocrates is frequently represented in a distorted or caricatured manner, often appearing as a cripple. This portrayal of Harpocrates in a diminished form can symbolize his role as a youthful and sometimes fragile deity.\n\nDo you have any other questions about these deities or any other aspects of ancient Egyptian symbolism?"}
