These tendencies, which are often considered immoral or impossible, are not acknowledged in the conscious mind. This suggests that the unconscious mind plays a significant role in shaping our thoughts and can reveal aspects of our character that we are unaware of or do not want to recognize.\n\n\n**QUESTION:**\nHow does the text illustrate the conflict between conscious and unconscious tendencies?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nThe text illustrates the conflict between conscious and unconscious tendencies through the example of Oegger and his thoughts about Judas.

Could you explain what they refer to?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCertainly! Conscious phantasies refer to the thoughts and fantasies that come from innate tendencies in the soul that are either undeveloped or no longer recognized. These tendencies, which might be considered immoral or impossible, are not acknowledged in the conscious mind. This suggests that the unconscious mind plays a significant role in shaping our thoughts and can reveal aspects of our character that we are unaware of or do not want to recognize.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this concept or want to know more about how it relates to unconscious mind processes?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Can you give me an example of how the text illustrates the conflict between conscious and unconscious tendencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSure! The text illustrates the conflict between conscious and unconscious tendencies through the example of Oegger and his thoughts about Judas. Oegger, who found the damnation of Judas incompatible with God's goodness, was unconsciously conflicted about his own wish to be like Judas. He used the symbol of God's goodness to rationalize and meditate on his unconscious wish, which would have been too painful to confront directly. This shows how the conscious mind can rationalize and compensate for unconscious desires that are difficult to accept.\n\nIs there anything else you want to explore further about this example or the concept of conscious and unconscious tendencies?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. How do myths fit into all of this? What role do they play in the unconscious mind?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMyths play a crucial role in the unconscious mind as instruments of folk-psychological complex treatment. They function as symbols that help express and work through unconscious tendencies and desires that might be too painful to confront directly. These myths act as a way for individuals to process and understand their unconscious wish tendencies, often serving as a collective expression of deep psychological conflicts and aspirations.\n\nDo you have any more questions about myths or how they relate to the unconscious mind?"}
