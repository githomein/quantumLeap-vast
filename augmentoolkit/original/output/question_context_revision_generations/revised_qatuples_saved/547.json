{"paragraph": "“And Isis came with her wisdom:    Her mouth is full of the breath of life,    Her words banish sorrow,    And her speech animates those who no longer breathe.    She said: ‘What is that; what is that, divine father?    Behold, a worm has brought you sorrow——’“‘Tell me thy name, divine father,    Because the man remains alive, who is called by his name.’”Whereupon Rê replied:“‘I am he, who created heaven and earth, and piled up the hills,   And created all beings thereon.   I am he, who made the water and caused the great flood,   Who produced the bull of his mother,   Who is the procreator,’ etc.“The poison did not depart, it went further,   The great God was not cured.   Then said Isis to Rê:   ‘Thine is not the name thou hast told me.   Tell me true that the poison may leave thee,   For he whose name is spoken will live.’”Finally Rê decides to speak his true name. He is approximately healed (imperfect composition of Osiris); but he has lost his power, and finally he retreats to the heavenly cow.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "Why does Isis insist that Rê reveal his true name?", "answer": "Isis insists that Rê reveal his true name because she believes that the power of a name can cure illness and bring life. She tells Rê that the poison will leave him only if he speaks his true name, as the one whose name is spoken will live.", "question_group_id": "d455acfd-125b-4f0e-a56b-6ab3f40273c8", "paragraph_idx": 358, "question_idx": 2}
