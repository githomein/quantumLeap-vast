{"paragraph": "As in the beginning of our investigation the hero’s name forced us to speak of the symbolism of Popocatepetl as belonging to the creating part of the human body, so at the end does the Miller drama again give us an opportunity of seeing how the volcano assists in the death of the hero and causes him to disappear by means of an earthquake into the depths of the earth. As the volcano gave birth and name to the hero, so at the end of the day it devours him again.[854] We learn from the last words of the hero that _his longed-for beloved_, she who alone understands him, is called Ja-ni-wa-ma. We find in this name those lisped syllables familiar to us from the early childhood of the hero, Hiawatha, Wawa, wama, mama. The only one who really understands us is the mother. For _verstehen_, “to understand” (Old High German _firstân_), is probably derived from a primitive Germanic prefix _fri_, identical with περὶ, meaning “roundabout.” The Old High German _antfristôn_, “to interpret,” is considered as identical with _firstân_. From that results a fundamental significance of the verb _verstehen_, “to understand,” as “standing round about something.”[855] _Comprehendere_ and κατασυλλαμβάνειν express a similar idea as the German _erfassen_, “to grasp, to comprehend.” The thing common to these expressions is the surrounding, the enfolding. And there is no doubt that there is nothing in the world which so completely enfolds us as the mother. When the neurotic complains that the world has no understanding, he says indirectly that he misses the mother. Paul Verlaine has expressed this thought most beautifully in his poem, “Mon Rêve Familier”:_My Familiar Dream._", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "Based on the information provided, what does the volcano symbolize in the Miller drama at the end of the hero's journey?", "answer": "In the Miller drama, the volcano symbolizes the end of the hero's journey.
