{"paragraph": "“After Tiâmat had powerfully done her work   She conceived evil against the gods, her descendants;   In order to revenge Apsu, Tiâmat did evil.   When Ea now heard this thing   He became painfully anxious, sorrowfully he sat himself.   He went to the father, his creator, Ans̆ar,   To relate to him all that Tiâmat plotted.   Tiâmat, our mother, has taken an aversion to us,   Has prepared a riotous mob, furiously raging.”The gods finally opposed Marduk, the god of spring, the victorious sun, against the fearful host of Tiâmat. Marduk prepared for battle. Of his chief weapon, which he created, it is said:“He created the evil wind, Imḫullu, the south storm and the hurricane, The fourth wind, the seventh wind, the whirlwind and the harmful wind, Then let he loose the winds, which he had created, the seven: To cause confusion within Tiâmat, they followed behind him, Then the lord took up the cyclone, his great weapon; For his chariot he mounted the stormwind, the incomparable, the terrible   one.”His chief weapon is the wind and a net, with which he will entangle Tiâmat. He approaches Tiâmat and challenges her to a combat.“Then Tiâmat and Marduk, the wise one of the gods, came together,  Rising for the fight, approaching to the battle:  Then the lord spread out his net and caught her.  He let loose the Imḫullu in his train at her face,  Then Tiâmat now opened her mouth as wide as she could.  He let the Imḫullu rush in so that her lips could not close;  With the raging winds he filled her womb.  Her inward parts were seized and she opened wide her mouth.  He touched her with the spear, dismembered her body,  He slashed her inward parts, and cut out her heart,  Subdued her and put an end to her life.  He threw down her body and stepped upon it.”After Marduk slew the mother, he devised the creation of the world.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the initial reason for Tiâmat's plan against the gods according to the Enuma Elish?", "answer": "Tiâmat conceived evil against the gods, her descendants, to avenge Apsu, her father, who she believed the gods had wronged.", "question_group_id": "5c86dc9b-38ad-4b31-83d9-08856ba042c8", "paragraph_idx": 147, "question_idx": 0}
