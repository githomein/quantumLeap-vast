{"paragraph": "The strange conception of Tapas is to be translated, according to Deussen,[764] as “he heated himself with his own heat,[765] with the sense of ‘he brooded, he hatched.’” Here the hatcher and the hatched are not two, but one and the same identical being. As Hiranyagarbha, Prajâpati is the egg produced from himself, the world-egg, from which he hatches himself. He creeps into himself, he becomes his own uterus, becomes pregnant with himself, in order to give birth to the world of multiplicity. Thus Prajâpati through the way of introversion changed into something new, the multiplicity of the world. It is of especial interest to note how the most remote things come into contact. Deussen observes:“In the degree that the conception of Tapas (heat) becomes in hot  India the symbol of exertion and distress, the ‘tapo atapyata’ began  to assume the meaning of self-castigation and became related to the  idea that creation is an act of _self-renunciation_ on the part of the  Creator.”Self-incubation and self-castigation and introversion are very closely connected ideas.[766] The Zosimos vision mentioned above betrays the same train of thought, where it is said of the place of transformation: ὁ τόπος τῆς ἀσκήσεως.[767] We have already observed that the place of transformation is really the uterus. Absorption in one’s self (introversion) is an entrance into one’s own uterus, and also at the same time asceticism. In the philosophy of the Brahmans the world arose from this activity; among the post-Christian Gnostics it produced the revival and spiritual rebirth of the individual, who was born into a new spiritual world. The Hindoo philosophy is considerably more daring and logical, and assumes that creation results from introversion in general, as in the wonderful hymn of Rigveda, 10, 29, it is said:", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "According to the text, what is the significance of introversion in the context of creation?", "answer": "Introversion is significant in the context of creation as it is closely connected to self-incubation and self-castigation. It involves absorption in one’s self and is seen as an entrance into one’s own uterus. In the philosophy of the Brahmans, the world arises from this activity, while in post-Christian Gnosticism, it produces the revival and spiritual rebirth of the individual, who is born into a new spiritual world. This concept is also highlighted in the Rigveda hymn, which suggests that creation results from introversion in general.", "question_group_id": "e094dd10-a3bd-49c9-a71b-17eb555b9651", "paragraph_idx": 126, "question_idx": 3}
