The Priestess of Demeter seems to be the representative of the earth goddess, perhaps the furrow of the field.[666] The descent into the earth is also the symbol of the mother’s womb, and was a widespread conception under the form of cave worship. Plutarch relates of the Magi that they sacrificed to Ahriman, εἰς τόπον ἀνήλιον.[667] Lukian lets the magician Mithrobarzanes εἰς χωρίον ἔρημον καὶ ὑλῶδες καὶ ἀνήλιον,[668] descend into the bowels of the earth.

Julian gave an account from the Attis legend of a κατάβασις εἰς ἄντρον,[669] from whence Cybele brings up her son lover, that is to say, gives birth to him.[670] The cave of Christ’s birth, in Bethlehem (‘House of Bread’), is said to have been an Attis spelæum.A further Eleusinian symbolism is found in the festival of Hierosgamos, in the form of the _mystic chests_, which, according to the testimony of Clemens of Alexandria, may have contained pastry, salt and fruits. The synthema (confession) of the mystic transmitted by Clemens is suggestive in still other directions:“I have fasted, I have drunk of the barleydrink, I have taken from the  chest and after I have labored, I have placed it back in the basket,  and from the basket into the chest.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does the term \"ritual marriage\" likely symbolize in the context of the information provided in the text?", "answer": "The term \"ritual marriage\" likely symbolizes a symbolic union, often representing the connection between the earth goddess and the earth itself or the cycle of nature.
