{"paragraph": "We have observed previously that among the Arrhetophorian, pastry in the form of snakes and phalli, was thrown into a crevice in the earth. This was mentioned in connection with the ceremonies of fertilizing the earth. We have touched slightly already upon the sacrifice in the earth crevice among the Watschandies. The flood of death has passed characteristically into the crevice of the earth; that is, back into the mother again; because from the mother the universal great death has come in the first place. The flood is simply the counterpart of the vivifying and all-producing water: Ὠκεανοῦ, ὅσπερ γένεσις πάντεσσι τέτυκται.[709] One sacrifices the honey cake to the mother, so that she may spare one from death. Thus every year in Rome a gold sacrifice was thrown into the lacus Curtius, into the former fissure in the earth, which could only be closed through the sacrificial death of Curtius. He was the typical hero, who has journeyed into the underworld, in order to conquer the danger threatening the Roman state from the opening of the abyss. (Kaineus, Amphiaraos.) In the Amphiaraion of Oropos those healed through the temple incubation threw their gifts of gold into the sacred well, of which Pausanias says:“If any one is healed of a sickness through a saying of the oracle,  then it is customary to throw a silver or gold coin into the well;  because here Amphiaraos has ascended as a god.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "In the context of these specific ceremonies, what does the concept of \"flood of death\" signify, and how is it related to the mother earth?", "answer": "The \"flood of death\" signifies the reintegration of life back into the earth from which it originated. It represents a return to the mother earth, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life and death and the continuous flow of life from the mother earth.", "question_group_id": "e063f754-d066-46d3-ad6c-8ba96713795d", "paragraph_idx": 331, "question_idx": 1}
