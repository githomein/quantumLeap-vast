{"paragraph": "In this quotation we come upon the symbol of the waters, which we found in the mention of Ogyges in connection with the city. The maternal significance of water belongs to the clearest symbolism in the realm of mythology,[440] so that the ancients could say: ἠ θάλασσα—τῆς γενέσεως σύμβολον.[441] From water comes life;[442] therefore, of the two gods which here interest us the most, Christ and Mithra, the latter was born beside a river, according to representations, while Christ experienced his new birth in the Jordan; moreover, he is born from the Πηγή,[443] the “sempiterni fons amoris,” the mother of God, who by the heathen-Christian legend was made a nymph of the Spring. The “Spring” is also found in Mithracism. A Pannonian dedication reads, “Fonti perenni.” An inscription in Apulia is dedicated to the “Fons Aeterni.” In Persia, Ardvîçûra is the well of the water of life. Ardvîçûra-Anahita is a goddess of water and love (just as Aphrodite is born from foam). The neo-Persians designate the Planet Venus and a nubile girl by the name “Nahid.” In the temples of Anaitis there existed prostitute Hierodules (harlots). In the Sakaeen (in honor of Anaitis) there, occurred ritual combats as in the festival of the Egyptian Ares and his mother. In the Vedas the waters are called Mâtritamâh—the most maternal.[443] All that is living rises as does the sun, from the water, and at evening plunges into the water. Born from the springs, the rivers, the seas, at death man arrives at the waters of the Styx in order to enter upon the “night journey on the sea.” The wish is that the black water of death might be the water of life; that death, with its cold embrace, might be the mother’s womb, just as the sea devours the sun, but brings it forth again out of the maternal womb (Jonah motive[444]). Life believes not in death.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What are some specific examples provided in the passage of the maternal symbolism of water in different cultural contexts?", "answer": "The passage provides several examples of the maternal symbolism of water. For instance, in Christian mythology, Christ is born from the Πηγή, the \"sempiterni fons amoris,\" or \"eternal fount of love.\" In pagan mythology, the goddess of water and love, Ardvîçûra-Anahita, is often associated with perpetual springs and fountains, such as \"Fonti perenni\" in a Pannonian dedication and \"Fons Aeterni\" in an inscription in Apulia.", "question_group_id": "5beb1593-ce9a-44bd-b8ef-7a982c7ce815", "paragraph_idx": 529, "question_idx": 2}
