{"paragraph": "“Nit, the ancient, the mother who bore the light god, Râ, who bore  first of all, when there was nothing which brought forth.“The cow, the ancient, which bore the sun, and then laid the germ of  gods and men.”The word “nun” has the significance of young, fresh, new, also the on-coming waters of the Nile flood. In a transferred sense “nun” was also used for the chaotic primitive waters; in general for the primitive generating matter[488] which was personified by the goddess Nunet. From her Nut sprang, the goddess of heaven, who was represented with a starry body, and also as the heavenly cow with a starry body.When the sun-god, little by little, retires on the back of the heavenly cow, just as poor Lazarus returns into Abraham’s bosom, each has the same significance; they return into the mother, in order to rise as Horus. Thus it can be said that in the morning the goddess is the mother, at noon the sister-wife and in the evening again the mother, who receives the dying in her lap, reminding us of the Pietà of Michelangelo. As shown by the illustration (from Dideron’s “Iconographie Chrétienne”), this thought has been transferred as a whole into Christianity.Thus the fate of Osiris is explained: he passes into the mother’s womb, the chest, the sea, the tree, the column of Astartes; he is dismembered, re-formed, and reappears again in his son, Hor-pi-chrud.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How is the goddess Nut described in ancient Egyptian texts?", "answer": "The goddess Nut is described as the goddess of heaven, often represented with a starry body or as the heavenly cow with a starry body.", "question_group_id": "58e3a227-d977-4fea-87b6-1229ff26b813", "paragraph_idx": 97, "question_idx": 1}
