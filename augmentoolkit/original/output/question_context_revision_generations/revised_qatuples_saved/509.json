{"paragraph": "There is still to be considered one more source of the reanimation of the mother-imago. We have already met it in the discussion of the mother scene in “Faust,” that is to say, _the willed introversion of a creative mind_, which, retreating before its own problem and inwardly collecting its forces, dips at least for a moment into the source of life, in order there to wrest a little more strength from the mother for the completion of its work. It is a mother-child play with one’s self, in which lies much weak selfadmiration and self-adulation (“Among a hundred mirrors”—Nietzsche); _a Narcissus state_, a strange spectacle, perhaps, for profane eyes. The separation from the mother-imago, the birth out of one’s self, reconciles all conflicts through the sufferings. This is probably meant by Nietzsche’s verse:“Why hast thou enticed thyself         Into the Paradise of the old serpent?         Why hast thou crept         Into thyself, thyself?...“A sick man now         Sick of a serpent’s poison,[620]         A captive now         Whom the hardest destiny befell         In thine own pit;         Bowed down as thou workest         Encaved within thyself,         Burrowing into thyself,         Helpless,         Stiff,         A corpse.         Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,         Overburdened by thyself.         A wise man,         A self-knower,         The wise Zarathustra;         Thou soughtest the heaviest burden         And foundest thou thyself....”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the significance of the \"Narcissus state\" in the creative process?", "answer": "The \"Narcissus state\" is significant in the context of the creative process as it represents a form of introspection and self-admiration. It refers to a creative individual looking into their own psyche, much like Narcissus gazed at his reflection in the water. This state is described as a strange spectacle for those who are not familiar with it and symbolizes the deep introspective journey of the creative mind. It is a moment of self-reflection and self-adulation, where one deeply contemplates their own essence, akin to the \"Among a hundred mirrors\" reference from Nietzsche.", "question_group_id": "cb73e9eb-93f3-4677-9da9-32c55c437279", "paragraph_idx": 372, "question_idx": 3}
