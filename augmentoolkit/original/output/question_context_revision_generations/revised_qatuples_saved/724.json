{"paragraph": "The teleological meaning of the hero, as that symbolic figure which unites in itself libido in the form of admiration and adoration, in order to lead to higher sublimations by way of the symbolic bridges of the myths, is anticipated here. Thus we become quickly acquainted with Hiawatha as a savior, and are prepared to hear all that which must be said of a savior, of his marvellous birth, of his early great deeds, and his sacrifice for his fellow-men.The first song begins with a fragment of evangelism: Gitche Manito, the “master of life,” tired of the quarrels of his human children, calls his people together and makes known to them the joyous message:“I will send a prophet to you,         A Deliverer of the nations,         Who shall guide you and shall teach you,         Who shall toil and suffer with you.         If you listen to his counsels,         You will multiply and prosper.         If his warnings pass unheeded,         You will fade away and perish!”Gitche Manito, the Mighty, “the creator of the nations,” is represented as he stood erect “on the great Red Pipestone quarry.”“From his footprints flowed a river,          Leaped into the light of morning,          O’er the precipice plunging downward          Gleamed like Ishkoodah, the comet.”The water flowing from his footsteps sufficiently proves the phallic nature of this creator. I refer to the earlier utterances concerning the phallic and fertilizing nature of the horse’s foot and the horse’s steps, and especially do I recall Hippocrene and the foot of Pegasus.[632] We meet with the same idea in Psalm lxv, vv. 9 to 11:“Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it; thou makest it very  plenteous.“The river of God is full of water; thou preparest their corn, for so  thou providest for the earth.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What physical act does Gitche Manito perform, and what does it symbolize according to the text?", "answer": "Gitche Manito stands erect on the \"great Red Pipestone quarry.\" The water flowing from his footprints symbolizes his creative and life-giving power.", "question_group_id": "d455acfd-125b-4f0e-a56b-6ab3f40273c8", "paragraph_idx": 420, "question_idx": 1}
