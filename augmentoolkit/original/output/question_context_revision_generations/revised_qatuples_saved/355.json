{"paragraph": "We have already seen that the incest prohibition prevents the son from reproducing himself through the mother. But this must be done by the god, as is shown with remarkable clearness and candor in the pious Egyptian mythology, which has preserved the most ancient and simple concepts. Thus Chnum, the “moulder,” the “potter,” the “architect,” moulds his egg upon the potter’s wheel, for he is “the immortal growth,” “the reproduction of himself and his own rebirth, the creator of the egg, which emerged from the primitive waters.” In the Book of the Dead it says:“I am the sublime falcon (the Sun-god), which has come forth from his  egg.”Another passage in the Book of the Dead reads:“I am the creator of Nun, who has taken his place in the underworld.  My nest is not seen and my egg is not broken.”A further passage reads:“that great and noble god in his egg: who is his own originator of  that which has arisen from him.”[532]Therefore, the god Nagaga-uer is also called the “great cackler.” (Book of the Dead.) “I cackle like a goose and I whistle like a falcon.” The mother is reproached with the incest prohibition as an act of wilful maliciousness by which she excludes the son from immortality. Therefore, a god must at least rebel, overpower and chastise the mother. (Compare Adam and Lilith, above.) The “overpowering” signifies incestuous rape.[533] Herodotus[534] has preserved for us a valuable fragment of this religious phantasy.“And how they celebrate their feast to Isis in the city of Busiris, I  have already previously remarked. After the sacrifice, all of them,  men and women, full ten thousand people, begin to beat each other. But  it would be sin for me to mention for whom they do beat each other.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "According to the text, how is the concept of the egg central to the role of the god Chnum?", "answer": "The concept of the egg is central to Chnum's role as he is described as \"moulding his egg upon the potter’s wheel.\" This egg symbolizes his creation and rebirth, emphasizing his creative and reproductive aspects.", "question_group_id": "4912cb91-d11b-40c2-9217-76711e0283f1", "paragraph_idx": 164, "question_idx": 1}
