{"paragraph": "The phallic significance is expressed negatively or mysteriously through the serpent, which always points to a secret related thought. This related thought connects with the mother; thus, in a dream a patient found the following imagery: “A serpent shot out from a moist cave and bit the dreamer in the region of the genitals.” This dream took place at the instant when the patient was convinced of the truth of the analysis, and began to free himself from the bond of his mother complex. The meaning is: I am convinced that I am inspired and poisoned by the mother. The contrary manner of expression is characteristic of the dream. At the moment when he felt the impulse to go forwards he perceived the attachment to the mother. Another patient had the following dream during a relapse, in which the libido was again wholly introverted for a time: “She was entirely filled within by a great snake; only one end of the tail peeped out from her arm. She wanted to seize it, but it escaped her.” A patient with a very strong introversion (catatonic state) complained to me that a snake was stuck in her throat.[759] This symbolism is also used by Nietzsche in the “vision” of the shepherd and the snake:[760]“And verily, what I saw was like nothing I ever saw before. I saw a  young shepherd, writhing, choking, twitching with a convulsed face,  from whose mouth hung a black, heavy serpent.“Did I ever see so much disgust and pallid fear upon a  countenance?[761] Might he have been sleeping, and the snake crept  into his mouth—there it bit him fast?“My hand tore at the serpent and tore—in vain!—I failed to tear the  serpent out of his mouth. Then there cried out of me: ‘Bite! Bite! Its  head off! Bite!’ I exclaimed; all my horror, my hate, my disgust, my  compassion, all the good and bad cried out from me in one voice.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the symbolic meaning of a serpent relate to the patient's state of mind when free from the mother complex, according to Freudian psychoanalytic theory?", "answer": "When a patient feels free from the bond of the mother complex, the serpent in their dreams might symbolize the opposite—attachment or entanglement with the mother. For example, a patient might dream: \"She was entirely filled within by a great snake; only one end of the tail peeped out from her arm. She wanted to seize it, but it escaped her.\" This dream suggests that despite feeling freer, the patient still grapples with the internalized influence of the mother.", "question_group_id": "0888d152-0dbc-43a2-8275-8a19b5602b0d", "paragraph_idx": 128, "question_idx": 1}
