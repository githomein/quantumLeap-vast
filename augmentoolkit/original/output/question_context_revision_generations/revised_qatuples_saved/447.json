This regression results in a return to an infantile state, where the parent image becomes synonymous with concepts like God, Sun, and Fire. This regression often manifests in the use of symbols like the sun and snake, which gather various libidinal symbols into a unified sun-symbol.", "question_group_id": "bf710d49-ad17-4dfc-baae-5dcf900c4787", "paragraph_idx": 547, "question_idx": 4}
