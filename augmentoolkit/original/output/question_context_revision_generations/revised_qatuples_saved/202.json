{"paragraph": "We come across a very similar motive in the cult legend of the Samian Hera. Yearly it was claimed that the image disappeared from the temple, was fastened somewhere on the seashore on a trunk of a Lygos tree and wound about with its branches. There it was “found,” and was treated with wedding-cake. This feast is undoubtedly a ἱερὸς γάμος (ritual marriage), because in Samos there was a legend that Zeus had first had a long-continued secret love relation with Hera. In Plataea and Argos, the marriage procession was represented with bridesmaids, marriage feast, and so on. The festival took place in the wedding month “Γαμηλιών” (beginning of February). But in Plataea the image was previously carried into a lonely place in the wood; approximately corresponding to the legend of Plutarch that Zeus had kidnapped Hera and then had hidden her in a cave of Cithaeron. According to our deductions, previously made, we must conclude from this that there is still another train of thought, namely, the magic charm of a rejuvenation, which is condensed in the Hierosgamos. The disappearance and hiding in the wood, in the cave, on the seashore, entwined in a willow tree, points to the death of the sun and rebirth. The early springtime Γαμηλιών (the time of Marriage) in February fits in with that very well. In fact, Pausanias informs us that the Argivian Hera _became a maiden again by a yearly bath in the spring of Canathos_. The significance of the bath is emphasized by the information that in the Plataeian cult of Hera Teleia, Tritonian nymphs appeared as water-carriers. In a tale from the Iliad, where the conjugal couch of Zeus upon Mount Ida is described, it is said:[492]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the month of Γαμηλιών (February) relate to the ritual and the concept of rebirth in the context of the text you are referring to?", "answer": "The month of Γαμηλιών at the beginning of February is significant because it marks the early springtime, a time when the sun appears to \"die\" and then \"rebirth.\" This timing aligns with the ritual practices involving the image of Hera, which symbolize the cycle of death and rebirth associated with the sun.", "question_group_id": "f43522bb-970f-4b69-8bde-62fba6cf694e", "paragraph_idx": 94, "question_idx": 3}
