{"paragraph": "Hence, when Hiawatha retires to rest under the pine-tree,[689] it is a dangerous step, because he resigns himself to the mother, whose garment is the garment of death (the devouring mother). As in the whale-dragon, the hero also in this situation needs a “helpful bird”; that is to say, the helpful animals, which represent the benevolent parents:“Suddenly from the boughs above him         Sang the Mama, the woodpecker;         ‘Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,         At the head of Megissogwon,         Strike the tuft of hair upon it,         At their roots the long black tresses;         There alone can he be wounded.’”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "In which specific passage of \"The Song of Hiawatha\" does the woodpecker assist Hiawatha in his situation?", "answer": "The woodpecker assists Hiawatha by giving him directions on how to strike the enemy, Megissogwon, advising him to aim at the head and specifically at the tuft of hair on the enemy’s scalp, which is their vulnerable spot.", "question_group_id": "1efc3b1a-687b-4399-bddc-a4443cb005e2", "paragraph_idx": 37, "question_idx": 2}
