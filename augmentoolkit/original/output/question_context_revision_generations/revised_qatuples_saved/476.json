{"paragraph": "“And he saw a youth approaching,         Dressed in garments green and yellow,         Coming through the purple twilight,         Through the splendor of the sunset;         Plumes of green bent o’er his forehead,         And his hair was soft and golden.”This remarkable apparition reveals himself in the following manner to Hiawatha:“From the Master of Life descending,         I, the friend of man, Mondamin,         Come to warn you and instruct you,         How by struggle and by labor         You shall gain what you have prayed for.         Rise up from your bed of branches;         Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!”Mondamin is the maize: a god, who is eaten, arising from Hiawatha’s introversion. His hunger, taken in a double sense, his longing for the nourishing mother, gives birth from his soul to another hero, the edible maize, the son of the earth mother. Therefore, he again arises at sunset, symbolizing the entrance into the mother, and in the western sunset glow he begins again the mystic struggle with the self-created god, the god who has originated entirely from the longing for the nourishing mother. The struggle is again the struggle for liberation from this destructive and yet productive longing. Mondamin is, therefore, equivalent to the mother, and the struggle with him means the overpowering and impregnation of the mother. This interpretation is entirely proven by a myth of the Cherokees, “who invoke it (the maize) under the name of ‘The Old Woman,’ in allusion to a myth that it sprang from the blood of an old woman killed by her disobedient sons”:[654]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does the youth represent, and how does he appear to Hiawatha in te pahssage?", "answer": "The youth in the passage represents the god Mondamin, who appears to Hiawatha dressed in green and yellow garments, coming through the twilight and sunset.
