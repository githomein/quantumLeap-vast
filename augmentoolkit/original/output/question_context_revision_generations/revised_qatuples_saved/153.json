{"paragraph": "The connection of nightmare and horse seems, at first glance, to be present also etymologically—nightmare and mare. The Indo-Germanic root for märe is _mark_. Märe is the horse, English mare; Old High German _marah_ (male horse) and _meriha_ (female horse); Old Norse _merr_ (_mara_ = nightmare); Anglo-Saxon _myre_ (_maira_). The French “cauchmar” comes from _calcare_ = to tread, to step (of iterative meaning, therefore, “to tread” or press down). It was also said of the cock who stepped upon the hen. This movement is also typical for the nightmare; therefore, it is said of King Vanlandi, “Mara trad han,” the Mara trod on him in sleep even to death.[520] A synonym for nightmare is the “troll” or “treter”[521] (treader). This movement (_calcare_) is proven again by the experience of Freud and myself with children, where a special infantile sexual significance is attached to stepping or kicking.The common Aryan root _mar_ means “to die”; therefore, _mara_ the “dead” or “death.” From this results _mors_, μόρος = fate (also μοῖρα[522]). As is well known, the Nornes sitting under the “world-ash” personify fate like Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. With the Celts the conception of the Fates probably passes into that of _matres_ and _matronæ_, which had a divine significance among the Germans. A well-known passage in Julius Cæsar (“De Bello Gallico,” i: 50) informs us of this meaning of the mother:“Ut matres familias eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus[523]  declararent, utrum prœlium committi ex usu esset, nec ne.”[524]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does the passage from Julius Caesar's \"De Bello Gallico\" suggest about the significance of mothers in ancient Celtic culture?", "answer": "The passage from Julius Caesar's \"De Bello Gallico\" suggests that in ancient Celtic culture, mothers had a significant role in determining whether a battle should be engaged. It states that mothers would use divination and prophecy (sortibus and vaticinationibus) to decide if a battle was appropriate, indicating their importance in matters of war and fate.", "question_group_id": "48295225-a3c7-4652-a9e1-8766f6983995", "paragraph_idx": 141, "question_idx": 5}
