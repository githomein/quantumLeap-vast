{"paragraph": "In this passage Freud plainly touches upon the question whether the well-known longing for reality of the paranoic dement (and the dementia præcox patients),[245] to whom I have especially called attention in my book, “The Psychology of Dementia Præcox,”[246] is to be traced back to the withdrawal of the “libidinous affluxes” alone, or whether this coincides with the so-called objective interest in general. It is hardly to be assumed that the normal “fonction du réel” (Janet)[247] is maintained only through affluxes of libido or erotic interest. The fact is that in very many cases reality disappears entirely, so that not a trace of psychological adaptation or orientation can be recognized. Reality is repressed under these circumstances and replaced by the contents of the complex. One must of necessity say that not only the erotic interest but the interest in general has disappeared, that is to say, the whole adaptation to reality has ceased. To this category belong the stuporose and catatonic automatons.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the \"fonction du réel\" mentioned in the passage, and what does it imply? In what circumstances does reality disappear in the patients discussed in the passage?", "answer": "The \"fonction du réel\" (the function of reality) refers to the maintenance of psychological adaptation and orientation in normal individuals. It implies that for normal functioning, reality is maintained through various forms of interest and not just through the presence of libidinal energy or erotic interest. In very many cases, reality disappears entirely, leaving no trace of psychological adaptation or orientation. This suggests that in such circumstances, reality is repressed and replaced by the contents of the complex, indicating a complete loss of the ability to adapt to or orient towards reality.", "question_group_id": "f5f69eca-a19e-4a08-ab3e-14b2c959d048", "paragraph_idx": 352, "question_idx": 1}
