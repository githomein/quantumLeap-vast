{"paragraph": "The serpent, as protector of the hoard, now lies on the treasure house. The fear of the maternal womb of death has become the guardian of the treasure of life. That the snake in this connection is really a symbol of death, that is to say, of the dead libido, results from the fact that the souls of the dead, like the chthonic gods, appear as _serpents_, as dwellers in the kingdom of the mother of death.[744] This development of symbol allows us to recognize easily the transition of the originally very primitive significance of the crevice in the earth as mother to the meaning of treasure house, and can, therefore, support the etymology of _Hort_, “hoard, treasure,” as suggested by Kluge, κεύθω, belonging to κὲῦθος, means the innermost womb of the earth (Hades); κύσθος, that Kluge adds, is of similar meaning, cavity or womb. Prellwitz does not mention this connection. Fick,[745] however, compares New High German _hort_, Gothic _huzd_, to Armenian _kust_, “abdomen”; Church Slavonian _čista_, Vedic _kostha_ = abdomen, from the Indo-Germanic root _koustho -s_ = viscera, lower abdomen, room, store-room. Prellwitz compares κύσθος κύστις = urinary bladder, bag, purse; Sanskrit _kustha-s_ = cavity of the loins; then κύτος = cavity, vault; κύτις = little chest, from κυέω = I am pregnant. Here, from κύτος = cave, κύυαρ = hole, κύαθος = cup, κύλα - depression under the eye, κῦμα = swelling, wave, billow, κῦρος = power, force, κύριος = lord, Old Iranian _caur_, _cur_ = hero; Sanskrit _çura -s_ = strong, hero. The fundamental Indo-Germanic roots[746] are _kevo_ = to swell, to be strong. From that the above-mentioned κυέω, κύαρ, κῦρος and Latin _cavus_ = hollow, vaulted, cavity, hole; _cavea_ = cavity, enclosure, cage, scene and assembly; _caulæ_ = cavity, opening, enclosure, stall[747]; _kuéyô_ = swell; participle, _kueyonts_ = swelling; _en-kueyonts_ = pregnant, ἐγηυέων = Latin _inciens_ = pregnant; compare Sanskrit _vi-çvá-yan_ = ", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the etymology of words like κύσθος, κύστις, and κύτος relate to the concept of the innermost womb of the earth (Hades) and the hoard, as discussed in [specific text or passage]?", "answer": "The etymology of words like κύσθος, κύστις, and κύτος, which are related to cavities or wombs, supports the concept of the innermost womb of the earth (Hades).
