{"paragraph": "“The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the  blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of  the body of Christ? For we being many are one bread, and one body; for  we are all partakers of one bread.”—_I Corinthians_ x: 16, 17.Bread and wine are the body and the blood of Christ; the food of the immortals who are brothers with Christ, ἀδελφοί, those who come from the same womb. We who are reborn again from the mother are all heroes together with Christ, and enjoy immortal food. As with the Jews, so too with the Christians, there is imminent danger of unworthy partaking, for this mystery, which is very closely related psychologically with the subterranean Hierosgamos of Eleusis, involves a mysterious union of man in a spiritual sense,[751] which was constantly misunderstood by the profane and was retranslated into his language, where mystery is equivalent to orgy and secrecy to vice.[752] A very interesting blasphemer and sectarian of the beginning of the nineteenth century named Unternährer has made the following comment on the last supper:“The communion of the devil is in this brothel. All they sacrifice  here, they sacrifice to the devil and not to God. There they have the  devil’s cup and the devil’s dish; _there they have sucked the head of  the snake_,[753] there they have fed upon the iniquitous bread and  drunken the wine of wickedness.”[754]Unternährer is an adherent or a forerunner of the “theory of living one’s own nature.” He dreams of himself as a sort of priapic divinity; he says of himself:“Black-haired, very charming and handsome in countenance, and every  one enjoys listening to thee on account of the amiable speeches which  come from thy mouth; therefore the maids love thee.”He preaches “the cult of nakedness.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does this text suggest is the nature of the union involved in the Christian communion?", "answer": "The text suggests that the union involved in the Christian communion is a mysterious spiritual union.
