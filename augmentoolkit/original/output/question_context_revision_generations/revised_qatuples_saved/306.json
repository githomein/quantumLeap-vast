{"paragraph": "Apparently Miss Miller had but little left over for the officer, which is humanly very intelligible. But in spite of that a deep and lasting effect emanates from this connection which places divinity on a par with the erotic object. The moods which apparently are produced by these objects do not, however, spring from them, but are manifestations of her strong love. When Miss Miller praises either God or the sun she means her love, that deepest and strongest impulse of the human and animal being.The reader will recall that in the preceding chapter the following chain of synonyms was adduced: the singer—God of sound—singing morning star—creator—God of Light—sun—fire—God of Love.Ἐγώ εἰμι σύμπλανος ὑμῖν ἀστὴρ καὶ ἐκ τοῦ βάθους ἀναλάμπων.[122]The mystic in religious ecstasies put himself on a plane with the stars, just as a saint of the Middle Ages put himself by means of the stigmata on a level with Christ. St. Francis of Assisi expressed this in a truly pagan manner,[123] even as far as a close relationship with the brother sun and the sister moon. These representations of “becoming-one with God” are very ancient. The old belief removed the becoming-one with God until the time after death; the mysteries, however, suggest this as taking place already in this world. A very old text brings most beautifully before one this unity with God; it is the song of triumph of the ascending soul.[124]“I am the God Atum, I who alone was.       I am the God Rê at his first splendor.       I am the great God, self-created, God of Gods,       To whom no other God compares.”“I was yesterday and know to-morrow; the battle-ground of Gods was  made when I spoke. I know the name of that great God who tarries  therein.“I am that great Phoenix who is in Heliopolis, who there keeps account  of all there is, of all that exists.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the author explain the moods Miss Miller experiences when she praises God or the sun in the text?", "answer": "The author explains that Miss Miller's moods, when she praises God or the sun, are not derived from the objects themselves but are instead manifestations of her strong and deep love.
