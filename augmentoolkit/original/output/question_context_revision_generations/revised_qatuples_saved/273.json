{"paragraph": "“Dead he lay there in the forest,          By the ford across the river.”This is typical of Hiawatha’s deeds. Whatever he kills, for the most part, lies _next to or in the water_, sometimes half in the water and half on the land.[647] It seems that this must well be so. The later adventures will teach us why this must be so. The buck was no ordinary animal, but a magic one; that is to say, one with an additional unconscious significance. Hiawatha made for himself gloves and moccasins from its hide; the gloves imparted such strength to his arms that he could crumble rocks to dust, and the moccasins had the virtue of the seven-league boots. By enwrapping himself in the buck’s skin he really became a giant. This motive, together with the death of the animal at the ford,[648] in the water, reveals the fact that the parents are concerned, whose gigantic proportions as compared with the child are of great significance in the unconscious. The “toys of giants” is a wish inversion of the infantile phantasy. The dream of an eleven-year-old girl expresses this:“I am as high as a church steeple; then a policeman comes. I tell him,  ‘If you say anything, I will cut off your head.’”The “policeman,” as the analysis brought out, referred to the father, whose gigantic size was over-compensated by the church steeple. In Mexican human sacrifices, the gods were represented by criminals, who were slaughtered, and flayed, and the Corybantes then clothed themselves in the bloody skins, in order to illustrate the resurrection of the gods.[649] (The snake’s casting of his skin as a symbol of rejuvenation.)", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does the analysis of the dream of an eleven-year-old girl reveal about her unconscious feelings towards her father?\n\n**ANSPIER:\nThe analysis reveals that the \"policeman\" in the dream refers to the father, whose large size is over-compensated by the comparison to a church steeple. This suggests that the girl has feelings of both admiration and fear towards her father, trying to assert dominance over him through her dream.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat is the significance of the gods being represented by criminals in Mexican human sacrifices?", "answer": "In Mexican human sacrifices, gods were represented by criminals who were killed, flayed, and their skins used by the Corybantes. This practice symbolized the resurrection of the gods, similar to the snake's process of shedding its skin as a symbol of rejuvenation.", "question_group_id": "279c8d56-6c7b-46e6-9c36-44ea4699cb5f", "paragraph_idx": 467, "question_idx": 5}
