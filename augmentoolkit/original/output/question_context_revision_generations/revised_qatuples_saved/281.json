{"paragraph": "The separation from the blessedness of childhood, from youth even, has taken the golden glamour from nature, and the future is hopeless emptiness. But what robs nature of its glamour, and life of its joy, is the poison of the retrospective longing, which harks back, in order to sink into its own depths:_Empedocles._“Thou seekest life—and a godly fire springs to thee,      Gushing and gleaming, from the deeps of the earth;      And, with shuddering longing,      Throws thee down into the flames of Aetna.“So, through a queen’s wanton whim,      Pearls are dissolved in wine—restrain her not!      Didst thou not throw thy riches, Poet,      Into the bright and bubbling cup!“Still thou art holy to me, as the Power of Earth      Which took thee away, lovely assassin!...      And I would have followed the hero to the depths,      Had Love not held me.”This poem betrays the secret longing for the maternal depths.[795]He would like to be sacrificed in the chalice, dissolved in wine like pearls (the “crater” of rebirth), yet love holds him within the light of day. The libido still has an object, for the sake of which life is worth living. But were this object abandoned, then the libido would sink into the realm of the subterranean, the mother, who brings forth again:_Obituary._(Unfinished poem.)“Daily I go a different path. Sometimes into the green wood, sometimes to the bath in the spring; Or to the rocks where the roses bloom. From the top of the hill I look over the land, Yet nowhere, thou lovely one, nowhere in the light do I find thee; And in the breezes my words die away, The sacred words which once we had.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What internal conflict does the speaker experience in relation to love and the maternal depths, as described in the text?", "answer": "The speaker experiences an internal conflict where he desires to be sacrificed and dissolved in the chalice, aligning with a maternal depth that brings about rebirth. However, love holds him back from this transformation, keeping him in the light of day. The libido still has an object for which life is worth living, but if this object were abandoned, the libido would sink into the maternal depths.", "question_group_id": "2139f276-22f6-4034-aa43-4a6467572161", "paragraph_idx": 10, "question_idx": 2}
