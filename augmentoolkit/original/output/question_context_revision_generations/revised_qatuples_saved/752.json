{"paragraph": "“Often I have that strange and poignant dream      Of some unknown who meets my flame with flame—      Who, with each time, is never quite the same,     Yet never wholly different does she seem.     She understands me! Every fitful gleam      Troubling my heart, she reads aright somehow:      Even the sweat upon my pallid brow     She soothes with tears, a cool and freshening stream.“If she is dark or fair? I do not know—     Her name? Only that it is sweet and low,      Like those of loved ones who have long since died.     Her look is like a statue’s, kind and clear;      And her calm voice, distant and dignified,     Like those hushed voices that I loved to hear.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the speaker describe the voice of the unknown person and its impact in the passage?", "answer": "The unknown person's voice is described as calm, distant, and dignified, similar to the hushed voices the speaker loved to hear.
