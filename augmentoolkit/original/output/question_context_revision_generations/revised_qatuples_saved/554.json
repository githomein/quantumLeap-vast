{"paragraph": "“This small poem made a profound impression upon me. I could not, of  course, find immediately a sufficiently clear and direct explanation  for it. However, a few days later when I once more read a certain  philosophical work, which I had read in Berlin the previous winter,  and which I had enjoyed very much, (I was reading it aloud to a  friend), I came across the following words: ‘La même aspiration  passionnée de la mite vers l’étoile, de l’homme vers Dieu.’ (The same  passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God.) I had  forgotten this sentence entirely, but it seemed very clear to me that  precisely these words had reappeared in my hypnagogic poem. In  addition to that it occurred to me that a play seen some years  previously, ‘La Mite et La Flamme,’ was a further possible cause of  the poem. It is easy to see how often the word ‘moth’ had been  impressed upon me.”The deep impression made by the poem upon the author shows that she put into it a large amount of love. In the expression “aspiration passionnée” we meet the passionate longing of the moth for the star, of man for God, and indeed, the moth is Miss Miller herself. Her last observation that the word “moth” was often impressed upon her shows how often she had noticed the word “moth” as applicable to herself. _Her longing for God resembles the longing of the moth for the “star.”_ The reader will recall that this expression has already had a place in the earlier material, “when the morning stars sang together,” that is to say, the ship’s officer who sings on deck in the night watch. The passionate longing for God is the same as that longing for the singing morning stars. It was pointed out at great length in the foregoing chapter that this analogy is to be expected: “Sic parvis componere magna solebam.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What analogy does the author use to describe the passion for God, and how does it connect to an earlier material discussed in the text?", "answer": "The author uses the analogy of \"when the morning stars sang together\" to describe the passionate longing for God. This analogy connects to an earlier material discussed in the text, where it refers to a ship’s officer who sings on deck in the night watch. Just as the morning stars symbolize divine harmony and longing, the ship’s officer’s singing represents a similar passionate longing for something greater.", "question_group_id": "3de74cbe-0e88-4a56-8fd0-d288d4c5281f", "paragraph_idx": 444, "question_idx": 3}
