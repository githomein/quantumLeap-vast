{"paragraph": " The chthonic god was probably always a serpent dwelling in a cave, and was fed with πελανοί.[741] In the Asclepiadean of the later period, the sacred serpents were scarcely visible, meaning that they probably existed only figuratively.[742] Nothing was left but the hole in which the snake was said to dwell. There the πελανοί[743] were placed; later the obolus was thrown in. The sacred cavern in the temple of Kos consisted of a rectangular pit, upon which was laid a stone lid, with a square hole; this arrangement serves the purpose of a treasure house. The snake hole had become a slit for money, a “sacrificial box,” and the cave had become a “treasure.” That this development, which Herzog traces, agrees excellently with the actual condition is shown by a discovery in the temple of Asclepius and Hygieia in Ptolemais:", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How did the physical representation of the sacred serpent change over time in the later period according to the text?", "answer": "In the later period, the sacred serpents were scarcely visible, indicating that they existed only figuratively rather than in a tangible form.", "question_group_id": "8dfd45b2-87d1-4131-9373-5421b2379e32", "paragraph_idx": 96, "question_idx": 2}
