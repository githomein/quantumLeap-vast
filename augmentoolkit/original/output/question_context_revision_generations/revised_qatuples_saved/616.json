{"paragraph": "“The dream seemed to me to come from a mixture of the representation  of ‘Paradise Lost,’ ‘Job,’ and ‘Creation,’ with ideas such as ‘thought  which spontaneously produces its object’: ‘the gift of love,’ ‘chaos,  and cosmos.’”In the same way as colored splinters of glass are combined in a kaleidoscope, in her mind fragments of philosophy, æsthetics and religion would seem to be combined—“under the stimulating influence of the journey, and the countries  hurriedly seen, combined with the great silence and the indescribable  charm of the sea. ‘Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus.’ ‘Only this,  and nothing more!’”With these words, Miss Miller shows us out, politely and energetically. Her parting words in her negation, confirmed over again in English, leave behind a curiosity; viz., what position is to be negated by these words? “Ce ne fut que cela et rien de plus”—that is to say, really, only “le charme impalpable de la mer”—and the young man who sang melodiously during the night watch is long since forgotten, and no one is to know, least of all the dreamer, that he was a morning star, who came before the creation of a new day.[79] One should take care lest he satisfy himself and the reader with a sentence such as “ce ne fut que cela.” Otherwise, it might immediately happen that one would become disturbed again. This occurs to Miss Miller too, since she allowed an English quotation to follow,—“Only this, and nothing more,” without giving the source, it is true. The quotation comes from an unusually effective poem, “The Raven” by Poe. The line referred to occurs in the following:“While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—   ‘’Tis some visitor.’ I muttered, ‘tapping at my chamber door’—             Only this, and nothing more.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the source of the English quotation \"Only this, and nothing more,\" and how does it relate to Edgar Allan Poe's poem \"The Raven\"?", "answer": "The English quotation \"Only this, and nothing more\" is from the poem \"The Raven\" by Edgar Allan Poe. This line is a reference within the context of the poem, showing how even simple statements can carry deeper, more complex meanings or allusions.", "question_group_id": "e6402819-a01e-4cf7-b191-5ad79a60a2b4", "paragraph_idx": 311, "question_idx": 5}
