{"paragraph": "Found the beautiful Wenonah,         Lying there amid the lilies,         Wooed her with his words of sweetness,         Wooed her with his soft caresses,         Till she bore a son in sorrow,         Bore a son of love and sorrow.”Fertilization through the breath of the spirit is already a well-known precedent for us. The star or comet plainly belongs to the birth scene as a libido symbol; Nokomis, too, comes to earth as a shooting star. Mörike’s sweet poetic phantasy has devised a similar divine origin.“And she who bore me in her womb,         And gave me food and clothing.        She was a maid—a wild, brown maid,         Who looked on men with loathing.“She fleered at them and laughed out loud,         And bade no suitor tarry;        ‘I’d rather be the Wind’s own bride         Than have a man and marry.’“Then came the Wind and held her fast         His captive, love-enchanted;        And lo, by him a merry child         Within her womb was planted.”Buddha’s marvellous birth story, retold by Sir Edwin Arnold, also shows traces of this.[637]“Maya, the Queen ...    Dreamed a strange dream, dreamed that a star from heaven—    Splendid, six-rayed, in color rosy-pearl,    Whereof the token was an Elephant    Six-tusked and white as milk of Kamadhuk—    Shot through the void; and shining into her,    Entered her womb upon the right.”[638]During Maya’s conception a wind blows over the land:“A wind blew        With unknown freshness over lands and seas.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does the Wind represent in this excerpt, and what is the outcome of its encounter with the mother?", "answer": "The Wind represents a divine or spiritual force in the excerpt. It captures the mother, enchanting her with love, and as a result, she bears a merry child within her womb.", "question_group_id": "5e9471e0-ef54-4caf-9972-5912028a0a33", "paragraph_idx": 436, "question_idx": 3}
