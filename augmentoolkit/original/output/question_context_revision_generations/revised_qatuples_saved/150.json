{"paragraph": "The connection of nightmare and horse seems, at first glance, to be present also etymologically—nightmare and mare. The Indo-Germanic root for märe is _mark_. Märe is the horse, English mare; Old High German _marah_ (male horse) and _meriha_ (female horse); Old Norse _merr_ (_mara_ = nightmare); Anglo-Saxon _myre_ (_maira_). The French “cauchmar” comes from _calcare_ = to tread, to step (of iterative meaning, therefore, “to tread” or press down). It was also said of the cock who stepped upon the hen. This movement is also typical for the nightmare; therefore, it is said of King Vanlandi, “Mara trad han,” the Mara trod on him in sleep even to death.[520] A synonym for nightmare is the “troll” or “treter”[521] (treader). This movement (_calcare_) is proven again by the experience of Freud and myself with children, where a special infantile sexual significance is attached to stepping or kicking.The common Aryan root _mar_ means “to die”; therefore, _mara_ the “dead” or “death.” From this results _mors_, μόρος = fate (also μοῖρα[522]). As is well known, the Nornes sitting under the “world-ash” personify fate like Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. With the Celts the conception of the Fates probably passes into that of _matres_ and _matronæ_, which had a divine significance among the Germans. A well-known passage in Julius Cæsar (“De Bello Gallico,” i: 50) informs us of this meaning of the mother:“Ut matres familias eorum sortibus et vaticinationibus[523]  declararent, utrum prœlium committi ex usu esset, nec ne.”[524]", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the term \"mara\" relate to the concept of fate?", "answer": "The term \"mara\" is derived from the common Aryan root \"mar,\" meaning \"to die.\" This root also gives rise to the Latin \"mors\" and the Greek \"μόρος\" (mors), which means \"fate\" (also \"μοῖρα\" [moira]). Therefore, \"mara\" can be interpreted as the \"dead\" or \"death,\" and this concept is closely related to the idea of fate, as the Nornes (goddesses of fate) in Norse mythology are personified as determining life and death.", "question_group_id": "48295225-a3c7-4652-a9e1-8766f6983995", "paragraph_idx": 141, "question_idx": 3}
