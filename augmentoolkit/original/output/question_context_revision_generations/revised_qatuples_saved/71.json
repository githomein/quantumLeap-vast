{"paragraph": "We will now return to the visions of Miss Miller. Those now following need no further detailed discussion. The next vision is the image of a “purple bay.” The symbolism of the sea connects smoothly with that which precedes. One might think here in addition of the reminiscences of the Bay of Naples, which we came across in Part I. In the sequence of the whole, however, we must not overlook the significance of the “bay.” In French it is called _une baie_, which probably corresponds to a bay in the English text. It might be worth while here to glance at the etymological side of this idea. Bay is generally used for something which is open, just as the Catalonian word _badia_ (_bai_) comes from _badar_, “to open.” In French _bayer_ means “to have the mouth open, to gape.” Another word for the same is _Meerbusen_, “bay or gulf”; Latin _sinus_, and a third word is golf (gulf), which in French stands in closest relation to _gouffre_ = abyss. Golf is derived from “κόλπος,”[573] which also means “bosom” and “womb,” “mother-womb,” also “vagina.” It can also mean a fold of a dress or pocket; it may also mean a deep valley between high mountains. These expressions clearly show what primitive ideas lie at their base. They render intelligible Goethe’s choice of words at that place where Faust wishes to follow the sun with winged desire in order in the everlasting day “to drink its eternal light”:“The mountain chain with all its gorges deep,       Would then no more impede my godlike motion;       And now before mine eyes expands the ocean,       With all its bays, in shining sleep!”Faust’s desire, like that of every hero, inclines towards the mysteries of rebirth, of immortality; therefore, his course leads to the sea, and down into the monstrous jaws of death, the horror and narrowness of which at the same time signify the new day.", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "How does the word \"bay\" in English and French relate to the concept of openness?", "answer": "The word \"bay\" in English and \"baie\" in French both relate to the concept of something open. In English, a bay is generally understood as a body of water that is partially enclosed by land, similar to its French counterpart. The French verb \"bayer\" means \"to have the mouth open, to gape,\" which further emphasizes the idea of openness and the bay as a space that is receptive or exposed.", "question_group_id": "4df39f89-ce64-4d84-b589-1270b172ec44", "paragraph_idx": 225, "question_idx": 1}
