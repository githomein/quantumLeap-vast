{"paragraph": "We would show but slight justice, however, to the intellectual originality of our author, if we were satisfied to trace back the commotion of that sleepless night absolutely and entirely to the sexual problem in a narrow sense. That would be but one-half, and truly, to make use of the mystic’s expression, only the under half. The other half is the intellectual sublimation, which strives to make true in its own way the ambiguous expression of “the idea which produces its object spontaneously,”—_ideal creation in place of the real_.In such an intellectual accomplishment of an evidently very capable personality, the prospect of a spiritual fruitfulness is something which is worthy of the highest aspiration, since for many it will become a necessity of life. Also this side of the phantasy explains, to a great extent, the excitement, for it is a thought with a presentiment of the future; one of those thoughts which arise, to use one of Maeterlinck’s expressions,[76] from the “inconscient supérieur,” that “prospective potency” of subliminal combinations.[77]I have had the opportunity of observing certain cases of neuroses of years’ duration, in which, at the time of the beginning of the illness or shortly before, a dream occurred, often of visionary clarity. This impressed itself inextinguishably upon the memory, and in analysis revealed a hidden meaning to the patient which anticipated the subsequent events of life; that is to say, their psychologic meaning.[78] I am inclined to grant this meaning to the commotion of that restless night, because the resulting events of life, in so far as Miss Miller consciously and unconsciously unveils them to us, are entirely of a nature to confirm the supposition that that moment is to be considered as the inception and presentiment of a sublimated aim in life.Miss Miller concludes the list of her fancies with the following remarks:", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What does the author suggest is missing if the commotion of a sleepless night is attributed solely to a narrow sexual problem, according to the text?", "answer": "The author suggests that attributing the commotion of a sleepless night solely to a narrow sexual problem would be only half the story. The other half is the intellectual sublimation that seeks to create an idea which produces its object spontaneously, or in other words, to create an idea that brings about its reality.", "question_group_id": "77da2430-e91b-443e-8bbd-cae547e31011", "paragraph_idx": 306, "question_idx": 0}
