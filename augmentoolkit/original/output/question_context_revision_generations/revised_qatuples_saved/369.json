{"paragraph": "“Ye intrepid ones around me! solve for me the riddle which I saw, make  clear to me the vision of the lonesomest one.“For it was a vision and a prophecy; what did then I behold in  parable? And who is it who is still to come?“Who is the shepherd into whose mouth crept the snake? Who is the man  into whose throat all the heaviness and the blackest would creep?[762]“But the shepherd bit, as my cry had told him; he bit with a huge  bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent—and sprang up.“No longer shepherd, no longer man, a transfigured being, an  illuminated being, who laughed! Never yet on earth did a man laugh as  he laughed!“O my brethren, I heard a laugh which was no human laughter—and now a  thirst consumeth me, a longing that is never allayed.“My longing for this laugh eats into me. Oh, how can I suffer still to  live! And how now can I bear to die!”[763]The snake represents the introverting libido. Through introversion one is fertilized, inspired, regenerated and reborn from the God. In Hindoo philosophy this idea of creative, intellectual activity has even cosmogenic significance. The unknown original creator of all things is, according to Rigveda 10, 121, Prajâpati, the “Lord of Creation.” In the various Brahmas, his cosmogenic activity was depicted in the following manner“Prajâpati desired: ‘I will procreate myself, I will be manifold.’ He  performed Tapas; after he had performed Tapas he created these  worlds.”", "metadata": "psychology_of_unconscious", "question": "What is the significance of Prajâpati in Hindu philosophy, and how does the Rigveda 10, 121 relate this to the concept of creation?", "answer": "Prajâpati is the unknown original creator of all things in Hindu philosophy, according to Rigveda 10, 121. In the passage, the concept of Prajâpati's cosmogenic activity is compared to the idea of a shepherd biting the serpent's head, spitting it out, and transforming into a transcendent being. This relates to the process of regeneration and creation through introspective and divine inspiration.", "question_group_id": "26c1e3e3-47e9-4271-adeb-4583a6c80fb9", "paragraph_idx": 131, "question_idx": 2}
